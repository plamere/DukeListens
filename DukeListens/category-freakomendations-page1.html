 This is one of my favorite freakomendations.  iTunes suggests that if 
you like "Baby One More Time" by Britney Spears, you might like the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Report_of_Pre-war_Intelligence_on_Iraq">Report on Pre-War Intelligence on Iraq</a>".  <p></p>This
 recommendation just doesn't seem to make any sense in any context.  
iTunes has lots of users so presumably they have lots of data and 
Britney Spears is a very popular artist - so this can't be a cold start 
problem. Something went awry somewhere. <p></p>Or perhaps there's some reason - there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt8uNG02ixA">Britney Spears / Bob Dole connection</a> - or maybe the lyrics are some sort of subtle commentary on America's attitude toward Iraq. Hit me baby one more time indeed.

				<strong>If you like Norah Jones ...
You might like Ravi Shankar.</strong>

<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Come-Away-Me-Norah-Jones/dp/B00005YW4H"><img src="support_files/411XEC9SEYL.jpg"></a>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Ravi-Shankar/dp/B000AO4NL8/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1210808191&amp;sr=8-1"><img src="support_files/51FqjSObTHL.jpg"></a>
</p><p>
At first blush, this looks like a bad recommendation - the Starbucks 
queen seems quite removed from the Indian Master - it is hard to imagine
 any kind of connection between these two artists, but the connection is
 actually quite close.  Ravi Shankar is the father of Norah Jones.  This
 little tidbit - the paternity of Norah Jones - turns what seems to be a
 bad recommendation into a credible recommendation.  
</p><p>
Often we get recommendations like this - where they seem to make no 
sense, but with a little information the recommendations can become 
good, or at least reasonable.
</p><p>
Recently last.fm added a 'connections' tab to the set of artist tabs, so
 now it is easier to find these types of musical connections.

	<div class="entry-content">
				<a href="http://onellama.com/PlaylistMaker/index.jsp"><img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="support_files/logo.png"></a>One
 Llama is a music recommender that uses "acoustic analysis, cultural 
analysis and collaborative filtering tools for music navigation, 
discovery and search. On their website they say <em>One Llama uses a 
combination of Collaborative Filtering and Audio Similarity modeling to 
generate recommendations. Our model harvests cultural references and 
social networking data about each track, and listens to the audio using 
an advanced "virtual ear." The result is a stronger combined logic for 
all our recommendations. The One Llama method has the advantage of being
 able to give intelligent recommendations for new audio tracks 
immediately while becoming increasingly smarter as additional 
information is collected about the tracks from playlists, downloads, 
user feedback, etc.</em>
<p>
So with all that advanced mojo, one would expect some pretty good 
recommendations.  Here's a recommendation based on the seed song 'Hey 
Jude' (I chose the Elvis version because they didn't seem to have the 
Beatles version in their catalog).
</p><p>
<a href="http://onellama.com/PlaylistMaker/GetPlaylist?artist=3&amp;numSongs=10&amp;keyword=ELVIS+PRESLEY+-+Hey+Jude&amp;x=14&amp;y=11"><img src="support_files/_onellama-heyjude.png" alt="onellama-heyjude.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
There's no doubt that these songs are "like 'Hey Jude'", but somehow the
 recommendation lacks subtlety and novelty of a real recommendation.  
Clearly the songs are not acoustically similar (Arthur Fielder vs. Tiny 
Tim?), and I can't imagine any set of users that would be listening to 
this set of song, so this is not being driven by a collaborative 
filtering algorithm.  It seems that, at least for this recommendation, 
the primary driving force is metadata similarity. It is almost as if 
they just grabbed the Musicbrainz track data, tossed it all into a text 
similarity engine and turned the crank to get these similarities.
</p><p>
Zac points out another case where One Llama seems to be relying mostly 
on metadata.  Here's a playlist that One LLama generates for songs 
similar to  "Let Go" by Frou Frou.  The set seems mostly reasonable from
 an acoustic point of view - the playlist could have been constructed by
 an expert - and in fact it was.  The songs (with one exception) can all
 be found on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garden-State-Various-Artists/dp/B0002J58LK">Garden State soundtrack</a>.
<a href="http://onellama.com/PlaylistMaker/GetPlaylist?artist=3&amp;numSongs=10&amp;keyword=FROU+FROU+-+Let+Go&amp;x=19&amp;y=12"><img src="support_files/_shins-one-llama.png" alt="shins-one-llama.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
This is probably what one could expect from a collaborative filtering 
system. Lots of music listeners have bought the soundtrack. Any good CF 
algorithm will notice this and tie the items together. However, I don't 
think that is what is going on here.  Looking at the One LLama playlist,
 there is one song that is not on the Garden State album.  One Llama has
 added The Postal Service's 'Such Great Heights' to the playlist, while 
the Garden State has the cover of 'Such Great Heights' by Iron &amp; 
Wine - although this is a cover, they sound very different; one is 
electronic-noise-pop, while the other is strictly acoustic.  I suspect 
that, as with the Hey Jude example, One Llama is relying mostly on 
metadata similarity to determine similarity

</p><p>
Here's the track list for the Garden State:
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garden-State-Various-Artists/dp/B0002J58LK"><img src="support_files/_amazon-garden-state.png" alt="amazon-garden-state.png" border="0"> </a>
</p><p>
Using metadata to generate track similarity is not inherently bad. It 
makes sense to use what works best.  A young recommender company like 
One Llama doesn't have the deep user data necessary to generate good CF 
recommendations.  Creating recommendations based on automatic acoustic 
analysis is really hard, acoustic-based recommendations are frequently 
prone to making mistakes that no human would make. I suspect that One 
Llama has adjusted the dials on their recommender to give more weight to
 the metadata until they get more user data and their automated analysis
 is up to par.

<img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="support_files/_stalin&#32;similar&#32;artists.png" alt="stalin similar artists.png" border="0">
<p>Last.fm has a similar artist feature. When you are looking at the 
page for an artist they will show you artists that are similar based 
upon the wisdom of the crowds.  Last.fm can tell you for instance, that 
people who listen to Emerson, Lake and Palmer also listen to Yes.  
</p><p>
If you go the <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hillary+Rodham+Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> page at Last.fm and take a look at her 'similar artists' you'll find a motley crew that includes <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joseph+Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adolf+Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.  Perhaps not the types of world leaders that Hillary would want to be associated with.
</p><p>
It is even worse if you go to <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joseph+Stalin">Joseph Stalin's</a>
 page, where you'll find similar artists such as Michael Savage, Ann 
Coulter and Rush Limbaugh.

Now this was clearly engineered as a prank. Someone (or a group of 
someones), must have created a playlist  with Hillary, Adolf, Coulter, 
Limbaugh and Stalin and just played them over and  over again, feeding 
their play data into the Last.fm <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/">audioscrobbler</a>
 until Last.fm noticed the correlation and declared that they were 
similar artists.  This is one of the first instances of I've seen where a
 music recommender has been noticeably manipulated to produce a 
dishonest recommendation. It certainly demonstrates how these types of 
systems can be vulnerable to attack.
</p><p>
Luckily, there are some smart people working to protect us from this hacking.  <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/">Bamshad Mobasher </a>has some <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/mbbw-acmtoit-07.pdf">good</a> <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/wmb-soca07.pdf">papers</a> on the <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/bbm-itwp07.pdf">topic</a> that are <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/mbbs-ieee-intsys-07.pdf">worth</a> <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/bbm-dmin07.pdf">reading</a>.
</p><p>
As more people seek out long tail content, recommenders will become 
increasingly important, which means that the folks who are spamming and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_blog">splogging</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">seo</a>-ing, will be trying to hack our recommenders to get their remedies for hair loss treatment at the top of the list. <em>(Thanks Elias)</em>

Pandora would be purchasing Sponsored Links for his page. Well, I 
clicked on the link and much to my surprise I was brought to a Pandora

can't figure out the reason behind the Pandora ad placement. Something 
went awry somewhere - or perhaps there's some connection between KFW and
 Goldenboy that I don't know about. Perhaps Pandora or the Echonest can

				I hope people don't think I am picking on Amazon. Amazon clearly has
 one of the best recommenders in the world.  The last time I went to 
Amazon, I intended to buy 1 book,  I ended up with 5 all because of 
their recommender.  99% of the recommendations from the Amazon 
recommender are spot on - but there's a small number of recommendations 
that are surprising, funny or just plain crazy.  Now this doesn't always
 mean that these are bad recommendations.  For example, here's one that 
was sent to me by <a href="http://flyingpudding.com/">Anita Lillie</a>. She says:
<p>
<em>I noticed you are posting freakomendations on your blog, and it 
reminded me of how I was looking for flowers for a mother-in-law-type 
person for Christmas last year, and I got a recommendation for the video
 game Halo.  I went back today to try to find the same recommendation, 
but I couldn't find it.  Instead, I see a "recommendation" ("other 
customers who bought... also bought...") for the movie "Hot Fuzz" fairly
 frequently within the "flowering indoor plants" product category. 
Anyway, it was particularly funny with the Halo, and I'm guessing it's 
all those 20-something guys who go online to order something for their 
moms.</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>
As Anita suggests, the demographic of Amazon flower purchases probably 
skews to 20-somthing guys getting something for their moms, so throwing 
in Halo or Hot Fuzz, may not be a bad way for Amazon to make an extra 
sale or two.

This is what happened with<a href="freakomendations.html"> yesterday's Steve Martin freakomendation</a>, where Amazon recommended a book by the wrong Steve Martin. <a href="https://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a>,
 another book recommender, at least understands that there are two Steve
 Martin's that write books, but they still can't tell them apart. At the
 <a href="https://www.librarything.com/author/martinsteve&amp;norefer=1">LibraryThing author page for Steve Martin</a> there is this notice: <em>Steve
 Martin is actually two authors, Steve Martin the comedian and author of
 Cruel Shoes, Kindly Lent By Their Owner: The Private Collection of 
Steve Martin, Shopgirl, Pure Drivel, WASP, The Pleasure of My Company, 
and Born Standing Up; and Steve Martin the author of Britain and the 
Slave Trade. In the future LibraryThing will be able to split authors 
with identical names. At present, it cannot. </em>  
</p><p>
This makes be appreciate <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> so much more.  MusicBrainz knows all about the various <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/search/textsearch.html?query=oasis&amp;type=artist&amp;limit=&amp;handlearguments=1">ambiguous artist names</a> and can tell them apart.  I guess there's no such thing as BookBrainz yet.

				Here's a recommendation from Netflix.  Because you enjoyed Trekkies, Netflix suggests that you'll enjoy Frontier House.

				Some people are bird watchers, some collect cars.  I like to collect unusual recommendations.  I'm calling these '<a href="http://freakomendations.com/">Freakomendations</a>'.  There's almost always a story behind the recommendation - but sometimes it is hard to track them down. 
<p>
This recommendation, Amazon suggests that since Aaron Hurly has 
purchased books by Steve Martin, he may be interested in the (no doubt) 
hilarious

It looks like Amazon decided that the Steve Martin who edited this book was that same wild and crazy guy.
