				<p><b>#2 - Microsoft didn't try</b>
- With Apple merely treading water in 2006 it seemed that there might be
 room for a challenger. The obvious candidate was Microsoft's 
Zune.&nbsp; On paper the Zune looked like it could be a serious 
contender. It had some novel features like wifi and song sharing. It had
 a nice display and cool interface.&nbsp; But the Zune had a few 
problems at launch.&nbsp; The gadget bloggers had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006/11/13/installing-the-zune-sucked/">horrible install problems</a> with the first Zunes.&nbsp; There were some rather strange <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/-flx-/294929001/in/set-72157594292367584">images</a> and <a href="http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/microsoft-releases-monster-zune-ad">advertisements.</a>
 The device itself looked and felt like a brick compared to the 
iPod.&nbsp; The device didn't support podcasts.&nbsp; It didn't work 
with Vista.&nbsp; You had to use confusing Zune Points to buy songs. And
 on and on. Now these glitches could have been forgiven - Microsoft is 
known for under-delivering on version 1.0 products - if the core 
experience was novel and interesting.&nbsp; But the key distinguishing 
feature of the Zune - the song sharing (aka 'squirting') was hamstrung -
 by overbearing DRM - the shared songs would dissolve after 3 plays or 3
 days.&nbsp; The Zune wifi couldn't be used for syncing or listening to 
streaming internet radio.&nbsp; Microsoft turned its back on its 
PlayForSure licensees by creating a new and incompatible DRM - (the only
 reason was to create their own iTunes-like proprietary music silo) and 
perhaps worst of all Microsoft bought into the fiction put forward by 
the music labels that anyone with a digital music player must be a 
thief. Microsoft agreed to pay a<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/09/on-universal-music-groups-zune-tax/"> music tax to Universa</a>l
 for every Zune sold.&nbsp; It was almost as if Microsoft wasn't even 
trying with the Zune.&nbsp; Bill Gates even said admitted that Microsoft
 had only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006/11/18/gates-praises-ipod-labels-zune-a-modest-competitor/">'modest'</a>
 aspirations with the Zune.&nbsp; Despite my misgivings about Microsoft 
in general, I was really hoping that they would do something interesting
 with the Zune - at least that would stimulate some innovation in the 
digital music world.&nbsp; But I fear Michael Robertson's <a href="http://www.michaelrobertson.com/archive.php?minute_id=219">prediction about the Zune</a> will be right on the mark.&nbsp; <br>
