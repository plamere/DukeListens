 ...&nbsp; yet another music discovery service.&nbsp; Goombah relies on 
social data to make music recommendations. Goombah looks at your iTunes 
music data and finds other simiilar music listeners and makes 
recommendations for you based on the listening habits of these similar 
music listeners.&nbsp; Yet another variation of the 'people who liked 
XXX also liked YYY.&nbsp; Goombah makes its money by referring listeners
 to music sellers like Amazon and iTunes. <br><br>It seems like the social discovery space is getting pretty full. There's <a href="https://last.fm/" target="_self">last.fm</a>, the <a href="http://itunesregistry.com/" target="_self">itunes registery</a>, <a href="http://musicmobs.com/" target="_self">MusicMobs,</a> <a href="http://musicstrands.com/" target="_self">MusicStrands,</a>
 tons of playlist sites, and of course all the big music sites like 
iTunes and Yahoo that rely on social data to recommend music.&nbsp; At 
this point it seems that any social site that is trying to hook 
listeners up with new music has to find a way to let the listener 
actually listen to the music, not just give them 30 second samples. 
&nbsp; The 30 second samples are far too short for me to decide if I 
want to buy a song or not.&nbsp; This is a tough nut to crack with the 
current music laws. A service has to either own the rights to the music 
(like Yahoo or iTunes), have a license to stream the audio (like 
last.fm), or have some otherway of resolving the music to a music 
service (like MusicMobs).&nbsp; Without the music I don't think a 
recommender can be successful.&nbsp; Goombah says that they'll be 
offering some music downloads in a few months so perhaps they'll find a 
way to make it work.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<br>This week on the <a href="http://thisweekintech.com/itn6" target="_self">Inside the net podcast</a> is an interview with Tim Westergren of <a href="https://pandora.com/" target="_self">Pandora.</a>&nbsp;
 Pandora is a content-based music recommender/music streamer.&nbsp; In 
the interview, Tim enthusiastically describes how the Pandora and the 
underlying music genome project works.&nbsp; According to TIm, at 
Pandora, they have about 40 musicians that spend their days labelling 
songs with about 400 different attributes.&nbsp; It takes about 20 to 30
 minutes for their trained musician to rate a song, and they are 
currently adding about 7,000&nbsp; songs a month. After six years, 
Pandora has amassed labels for hundreds of thousands of songs and can do
 a find job of recommending music based upon similarity.&nbsp; However, 
they do have difficulties with scale.&nbsp; They are only able to add a 
very small fraction of new music each year and have to pick and choose 
which songs get added to their database.&nbsp; They skip some genres 
completely. For instance, there is no Classical music in Pandora.&nbsp; 
One of the advantages of a content-based recommender like Pandora has 
over the more traditional collaborative filtering models used in systems
 like <a href="https://www.last.fm/" target="_self">last.fm</a> is that 
they are immune to the popularity bias that is found in the 
collaborative filtering systems.&nbsp; A content-based system is just as
 likely to recommend a garage band as it is to recommend the Beatles, 
since it is immune to popularity, whereas a collaborative filtering 
system that is based upon user listening patterns is much more likely to
 ignore the unknown bands. They don't recommend unknown bands because no
 one is listening to them.&nbsp; Content-based recommenders can push 
listeners into the <a href="https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html" target="_self">long tail</a>
 of music, finding unknowns that sound like music we already like.&nbsp;
 Unfortunately for Pandora, the scaling problem makes them less likely 
to be able push people into the long tail. Pandora has to pick and chose
 which songs to process, and they will start with the most popular songs
 first, so they really can't push people too far into the long tail 
(yet).&nbsp; Despite these issues, Pandora is really good way to explore
 and discover new music.&nbsp; It is worth trying, and since it relies 
on&nbsp; flash, it runs on just about any platform out there..&nbsp; <br><br><br>

At CES this&nbsp; week, Gracenote announced a new product called 
'Discover' that will provide music recommendation services for online 
music services. Gracenote Discover is using 3 techniques:<br>
<ul>
<li>Music experts label the music with 'micro-genres' a fine grained set of genre labels (they claim to use 1600 genres).</li>
<li>Content-based - using 'DSP technology'</li>
<li>Community Preferences - collaborative filtering such as one finds at Amazon.com.</li></ul>Gracenote says that their engine is the <span class="epi-fontLg">Industry's First Global Multi-Method Music Recommendation Engine that "</span>ensures the optimal music is recommended every time".&nbsp; <br><br>The
 claim 'ensures he optimal music is recommended every time" makes me 
smile a bit.&nbsp; Anyone who has worked with any kind of recommender 
engine, and especially with music recommendation based upon acoustic 
similarity knows that there is no such thing as an optimal music 
recommender.&nbsp; In fact, music information retrieval researchers are 
still trying to figure out how to compare similarity engines to 
determine if one is better than another.&nbsp; The problem, of 
course,&nbsp; is that music similarity is a very subjective 
metric.&nbsp; I may think two songs are similar because of the lyric 
content, while someone else may think they are very different based upon
 the intstrumetation.&nbsp; There's no right answer.&nbsp; The same 
holds true for music recommendation in general. There's never a 'right 
answer', so saying that a system ensures the optimal music is 
recommended is, well, rather funny.<br><br>Here is the press release: <a href="http://www.gracenote.com/corporate/press/article.html/date=2006010501"><span class="epi-fontLg">Gracenote Introduces Discover -- Industry's First Global Multi-Method Music Recommendation Engine</span></a><br><br>

				<br>During the week long break (At Sun it's a week long holiday 
between Christmas and New Years), we have lots of time at home to play 
games. &nbsp; At the Lamere household we have some rather stringent 
gaming requirements: the game must allow for 5 or more players (4 kids, 
mom's not a game player), age range 10,14,15,16 and 45, so we have to 
avoid the extremely complicated rules, need a 1 hour playtime, and have a
 high entertainment factor.&nbsp; This year's game of the year by far 
(well, we never got to the other games, we've just played this one, 
we've had so much fun) is <a href="http://killerbunnies.com/" target="_self">Killer Bunnies</a>
 and the Quest for the magic carrot.&nbsp; This is a card game where you
 have to acquire the magic carrot, while keeping your bunnies alive (and
 trying to destroy your enemy's bunnies).&nbsp; It's a lot of 
fun.&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="" src="support_files/bunnies.html">The best 
part of the game is the player interaction. You can threaten, bribe, 
weedle and&nbsp; whine your way through the game. Making deals and 
finding leverage is the only way to win.&nbsp; You also find out 
interesting things about each other. For instance, I found out that my 
15 year old daughter would rather sacrifice all of her and her siblings 
bunnies to a nuclear strike (and virtually eliminating any chance of 
victory for any of them) rather than give in to blackmail.&nbsp; Woah!<br><br>

Ever since the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mix_tape">mix tape</a>,&nbsp;
sharing of music has
been one of the best ways for people to find out about new music.
&nbsp; The original Napster brought this sharing to a new level, where
one could browse the music collection of any one of millions of
people.&nbsp; If you found someone in the Napster network that had
similar tastes in music, it was easy to look through their entire music
collection and see what they may be listening to that you didn't know
about. It was a great way to explore new artists.&nbsp; Now of course,
this avenue of music discovery has been shutdown, but there are a
number of new services out there that are helping to fill this social
gap left by the
shutdown. Sites like <a href="https://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a>, <a href="http://soundflavor.com/Pages/">SoundFlavor,</a> <a href="http://www.musicstrands.com/">MusicStrands,</a>&nbsp; and the
<a href="http://itunesregistry.com/">iTunesRegistry,</a> provide ways for people to explore new music by finding
others that have similar music tastes.&nbsp; A new report: <a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/home/uploads/511/11-ConsumerTasteSharing.pdf">Consumer
Taste Sharing is Driving the Online Music Business and Democratizing
Culture</a>, (first seen on the <a href="http://digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000270072379/">Digital Music WebLog</a>),
provides lots of data to back up the assertion that music sharing is
very important to the music industry.&nbsp; Authors<a href="https://www.gartner.com/AnalystBiography?authorId=7846"> Mike McGuire</a> and
<a href="https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/cmusings/about">Derek Slater</a> suggest that online music services will be more desireable
if they provide better ways for users to share music (or at least share
their taste in music) with others.&nbsp; They predict that in a few
years, 25% of all online music sales will be as a result of people
sharing their music tastes with each other, but before this can happen, copyright holders will need to provide more <a href="http://www.openmediacommons.org/">flexible DRM</a> and licensing rules.<br>

out.&nbsp; Indeed,&nbsp; I am waiting for the day when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/columnists/free_forbes/2005/0131/042.html">Music Flows Like Water</a>, but I don't think that the recording industry is ready to switch models, it seem that they'd much rather see <a href="https://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/7086.cfm">Subpoenas Flow Like Water</a>.<br>

Amazon is always doing cool things with their data. One thing that
they've added recently are some text stats. They have the usual
readability indices (Fog, Flesch, Flesch-Kincaid), complexity
measures&nbsp; and such.&nbsp; For instance, here's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/sitb-next/0471056693/ref=sbx_txt/104-7562587-5349546?%5Fencoding=UTF8#textstats">some data</a> for the classic book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471056693/ref=pd_sim_b_3/104-7562587-5349546?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">Pattern Classification</a>. One 'fun stat' that they have is&nbsp; words per dollar and words per ounce.<br>
<br>
Here's some words per dollar for some of my favorite books:<br>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/sitb-next/0060512806/ref=sbx_txt/104-7562587-5349546?%5Fencoding=UTF8#textstats">Cryptonomicon:</a> 50,053&nbsp; words/dollar<br>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345371135/qid=1133663095/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-7562587-5349546?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">Quincunx:</a> 33,391 words/dollar</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/sitb-next/0441003257/ref=sbx_txt/104-7562587-5349546?%5Fencoding=UTF8#textstats">Good Omens</a>:&nbsp; 15,149 words/dollar</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/sitb-next/0694003611/ref=sbx_txt/104-7562587-5349546?%5Fencoding=UTF8#textstats">Goodnight Moon</a>: 16 words/dollar</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0689807481/qid=1133663795/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-7562587-5349546?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">Good Dog, Carl:</a>&nbsp; 4 words/dollar</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
Clearly there's a wide range of words per dollar here, if we
somehow&nbsp; could get Neal Stephenson to write a book in the Good Dog
Carl series, I think we'd be able to sell it for about $100,000 a copy , (or maybe it would be 3 for a penny) .... woah!<br>

<br>
When I was a teenager, the best way to find out about new music was
listening to FM radio.&nbsp; In the Boston area we could listen to the <a href="http://www.bigmattress.com/">big mattress</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album_Oriented_Rock">album oriented rock</a>
stations and always find new and interesting music to listen to.&nbsp;
Today however, the FM dial is now a great wasteland if you are
interested in new music.&nbsp; Try this experiment.&nbsp; Grab a
pencil, a piece of paper, sit in your car and scan the FM dial and keep
track of how many stations you actually hear music that was recorded in
the last 10 years.&nbsp; It is really quite depressing. Here are my
stats (data collected in Nashua NH at 7:24 AM on December 2, 2005).<br>
<br>
<pre>	Type	  	Station count	Percent<br>	-------------------------------------------<br>	Talk Radio	11		37%<br>	Commercials	 9		30%<br>	Oldies		 7		23%<br>	Christmas Music	 2		 7%<br>	New Music	 1		 3%<br><br></pre>
<p>That's 1 station out of 30 playing new music during prime commuting time.&nbsp; I wonder how this <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2001/04/30/clear_channel/">could have happened.</a><br>

The <a href="http://ismir2005.ismir.net/proceedings/index.html">proceedings for ISMIR 2005</a>
have been posted, so if you didn't make it to this year's Music
Information Retrieval conference you can do the next best thing and
read all the papers. There's quite a range of topics including user
studies, audio classification, symbolic classification, toolsets.&nbsp;
A good place to start is <a href="http://ismir2005.ismir.net/proceedings/1020.pdf">A Survey of Music Information Retrieval Systems</a> a survey paper describing the various content-based music information retrieval systems.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
For the hard-core math weenies out there, the paper that seems to have the highest density of equations to text is <br>
the paper <a href="http://ismir2005.ismir.net/proceedings/1130.pdf">Harmonic-Temporal Clustering via Deterministic Annealing EM Algorithm for Audio Feature Extraction</a> by Hirokazu Kameoka and friends with 35 labeled equations (one equation consumes nearly half a page of text).<br>
<br>
The paper by Charles Parker called <a href="http://ismir2005.ismir.net/proceedings/1104.pdf">Applications of Binary Classification and Adaptive Boosting to the Query-By-Humming Problem</a>
is a quite well written paper describing methods of symbolic alignment
using binary classifiers. (I tend to favor papers that rely on
pseudocode to explain things as opposed to maths, which is Mr. Parker's
approach).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://ismir2005.ismir.net/proceedings/3119.pdf">Foafing the Music: A Music Recommendation System based on RSS Feeds and User Preferences</a>
is a MIR meets Web 2.0 paper with lots of good ideas about combining
the various source of music information such as Audioscrobbler or
MusicStrands.<br>
<br>
There are about 700 pages of interesting reading on the ismir 2005
site. If you read 5 papers a week you'll be just about done when ISMIR
2006 rolls around. So get cracking.<br>
