Last night, Steve and I braved Lansdowne Street during the season's 
first Yankee/Redsox game to see the Tragically Hip.  It was a super 
show.  Lead singer, Gordon Downie puts on a great performance.  And I've
 never seen this many Canadians in place - but they were all very 
polite.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>For one of the Search Inside the Music demos that I'll be showing
 at the Sun Labs open house next week, I've been building up a database 
of music artists and related info.&nbsp; I've been gathering this 
data&nbsp; from many different places on the web using a crawler.&nbsp; 
It's not a fast process - it takes about a month to build up enough data
 to make it useful. &nbsp; My crawler collects the data and writes it 
out to a set of text files so that later it can be indexed with the our 
nifty search engine.</p><p>I tested the whole process using a small 
crawl of the web on my Linux laptop.&nbsp; When I was happy that 
everything was working fine, I started the crawl running on one of&nbsp;
 our large Solaris servers.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there was a lurking bug
 ... a Java programming 101 kind of bug that would make the data 
collected from the month long crawl be wrong.<br></p><p>Music artist names very international.&nbsp; There's <a href="https://www.google.com/musica?aid=0p4L5uFGJn&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=music&amp;ct=result">Björk</a>, there's <a href="https://www.google.com/musica?aid=aWH7XH3HTmD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=music&amp;ct=result">José <b>Feliciano</b></a> there's <a href="https://www.google.com/musica?aid=guAhKOtcHHD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=music&amp;ct=result">Mötley Crüe</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/musica?aid=FEY06SY3ZkL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=music&amp;ct=result">Motörhead</a>,&nbsp; (there's even a whole genre of music called<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_umlaut"> umlaut metal</a>).&nbsp;
 My mistake was forgetting that when&nbsp; writing a text file in Java 
(using&nbsp; a PrintWriter for instance), the default encoding used is 
the encoding of the operating system.&nbsp; Now for my Linux laptop, the
 default encoding is UTF-8 which can handle all of the umlauts and 
accents.&nbsp; But for our Solaris server, the default encoding is 
plain, old ASCII.&nbsp; With its 7 bits, ASCII can't represent any of 
the rich characters that are needed to represent all of the artist 
names.&nbsp; When I indexed my 30 days of data and started looking at 
the results I was very sad to see 'bj?rk"&nbsp; and "m?tley cr?e".&nbsp;
 </p><p>With our open house demo just 5 days from now, there's no way 
for me to recrawl the data and save it to disk using the proper 
encoding.&nbsp; Luckily, when I did the initial crawl, I resolved all of
 the artists to a <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> 
ID.&nbsp; I'm able to turn this ID back into the canonical name for the 
artist, so I am able to patch the names without having to do a 
recrawl.&nbsp; Whew! </p><p>So my lesson for the day is ... don't rely 
on the default encoding when reading and writing text. Now, back to 
getting the rest of the demo to work.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>For an application that I'm writing, I wanted to be able to 
persist a large number of objects.&nbsp; I wanted to avoid the 
complexities of a real database and the opaqueness and fragility of Java
 object serialization.&nbsp; What I really wanted was the ability to 
turn any object into a a bit of XML that I could save and load at will, 
without having to do a lot of work defining the mapping between the Java
 object and the XML. &nbsp;</p><p>There are a number of&nbsp; standard Java APIs to go back and forth between Java and XML, but they all seem a bit <a href="https://jaxp-sources.dev.java.net/nonav/docs/api/">complex</a> for what I wanted to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily, I stumbled upon <a href="http://xstream.codehaus.org/index.html">XStream.</a>&nbsp;
 XStream is a simple API for doing exactly what I wanted:&nbsp; 
serialize objects to XML and back again.&nbsp; The API is quite simple 
to use.&nbsp; To serialize an object to a file I use the code:</p><p></p><pre>            XStream xstream = new XStream();<br>            BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file));<br>            xstream.toXML(myObject, writer);<br>            writer.close()<br></pre><p>And to load the object I use:</p><pre>&nbsp;               BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));<br>                myObject =  (MyObject) xstream.fromXML(reader);<br>                reader.close();<br></pre><p>It couldn't be any easier than that.&nbsp; </p><p>XStream is fast, simple, and easy to use.&nbsp; Highly recommended.<br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://www.ghannimusic.com/">Ghanni music</a> is a 
content-based music recommender.&nbsp; Type in the name of an artist or a
 song, and you get recommendations based on music that sounds similar to
 that song or artist.&nbsp; According to their FAQ, Ghanni&nbsp; uses "<em>advanced pattern recognition and music signal analysis
techniques to estimate the similarities between your query and the
songs in our database. The similarity is a function of the rhythm,
timbre, instrumentation, vocals, and the music surface information we
automatically extract from a song</em>."</p><p>The web interface to 
Ghanni, unlike the latest round of social music recommenders,&nbsp; is 
focused totally on music recommendation. There are no friends, 
playlists, charts, games, users profiles or any of the seemingly 
standard features of a Music 2.0 site,&nbsp; just recommendations.</p><p><img src="support_files/ghanni.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="95%">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Ghanni actually gives you 3 types of recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>Song level recommendation</strong>s - this is something that a content-based site like Ghanni can in theory, do better than a social system,</li><li><strong>Think about artists</strong> - these are similar artists</li><li><strong>Playlist within the same atmosphere</strong></li></ul><p><strong>The Recommendations</strong></p><p>
 So how are the Ghanni recommendations?&nbsp; I found them to be rather 
curious.&nbsp; I've worked with enough content-based recommenders to 
know what to expect.&nbsp; Content-based recommenders will often 
recommend music by different artists, different genres and era.&nbsp; 
Content-based recommenders will do things like put&nbsp; Eleanor Rigby 
closer to a string quartet than to Helter Skelter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 
unlike social recommenders, content-based recommenders don't care about 
popularity, content-based recommendations will tend to include many more
 unknown artists than a social recommender. </p><p>The curious thing 
about Ghanni is that their recommendations seemed more like social 
recommendations than content-based recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I 
started with the song 'Hey Jude' by the Beatles.&nbsp; Recommendations 
received were 'Surfer Girl' by the Beach Boys, 'Dear Prudence' by the 
Beatles,&nbsp; 'Laughter in the Rain' by Neil Sedaka, 'Tangerine' by Led
 Zeppelin, and 'Fight for your honor' by Chicago.&nbsp; All classic rock
 from the same era by very popular artists.</p><p>Next up, I tried a 
song by 'Clap your hands say yeah' called 'Is this Love?'.&nbsp; I 
received recommendations for songs by Razorlight, Catatonia, Rilo Kiley,
 Stellstarr, and Bloc Party.&nbsp; All indie artists that have been 
popular in the last 5 years or so.</p><p>Final test - '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_9">Revolution #9</a>'
 by the Beatles.&nbsp; This song is so unlike any other song by the 
Beatles, or for that matter any other pop song released during the 60s 
or 70s. I'd expect recommendations for songs by artists such as&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen" title="Karlheinz Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage" title="John Cage">John Cage</a>.&nbsp; Instead, Ghanni gives me more Beatles, Ike and Tina Turner, Bo Diddley, and Tom McRae.&nbsp; Not a single example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te">Music Concrete</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 When I ask for a playlist within the same atmosphere, it looks like 
playlist from the latest classic rock radio station: Beatles, Led 
Zeppelin, Cream, Eagles, Doors, Ike and Tina.</p><p><em>Update: </em>Oscar points out that if you ask for <a href="http://www.ghannimusic.com/ghanni-music-selection.php?id=70216">recommendations related to a French song</a>,
 all of the recommendations are&nbsp; French songs.&nbsp; Although very 
desirable, this type of recommendation is far beyond the 
state-of-the-art for content-based recommendations.<br></p><p>So what is
 going on here? These don't seemed to be content-based recommendations 
at all!&nbsp; Are they trying to pull the wool over our eyes? My guess 
is that the scientists at Ghanni decided to use all data that was 
available to them to build their similarity models. So in addition to 
their content-based features related to timbre, pitch and tempo, they 
are including features that are typically found in a song's metadata. 
This include&nbsp; the year of release and the genre of the song.&nbsp; 
This is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, any machine learning 
scientist will tell you to use all of the data that you can.&nbsp; 
However, it appears that these features derived from the metadata are 
overwhelming the content based features.&nbsp; The resulting 
recommendations lack the 'aha' factor that come with content-based 
recommenders.&nbsp; There are no surprise linkages across genres. Just 
rather pedestrian recommendations that you could easily get from the All
 Music guide.</p><p>Ghanni seems to have some <a href="http://www.ghannimusic.com/ghanni-music-about1.php?an=3">smart people</a>
 on their team, so we can expect them to improve their recommendations. 
But for&nbsp; right now, the recommendations don't seem to be any better
 than what you could get from the many other music recommenders that are
 out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Thanks yet again&nbsp; for the tip, Oscar!</em><br></p><p><br></p>

There's a certain special vocal quality to be found in death metal which
 can be rather difficult on a young musicians voice. Luckily, there are 
some special exercises you can do to get your chords in shape:  <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Scream-for-Metal/hardcore/screamo">How to Scream for Metal/Hardcore/Screamo</a>.

				<p>Music genre is always a fuzzy concept - especially when you have 
artists cross over from one genre to another.&nbsp; Many times, an 
artist's first genre follows them along into new musical 
territory.&nbsp; For instance, today, I'm listening to some fantastic 
acoustic guitar that to my ear sounds Latin or Spanish.&nbsp; The music 
is&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Y_Gabriela">Rodrigo y Gabriela</a>
 which&nbsp; (according to Wikipedia) is a musical duo that got their 
start playing thrash metal in Mexico city - but moved onto acoustic 
guitars.&nbsp; Because of their mixed musical roots, they are not easy 
to classify - and it seems that everyone sticks them into a different 
genre:</p><ul><li>eMusic ( where I purchased the tracks) calls them <b>Latin</b><br></li><li>Wikipedia&nbsp; labels them <b>acoustic,</b>&nbsp; <b>folk rock</b> and <b>metal</b></li><li>All Music<b>&nbsp; </b>and Napster label them <b>world</b></li><li>iTunes labels them <b>reggae</b> (what's with that?)</li><li>last.fm users <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Rodrigo+y+Gabriela/+tags">label them</a> with tags like 'acoustic', 'flamenco' and 'guitar'</li></ul><p>Genre is tough ... yet it is still mostly useful ...</p><p>&nbsp;And here's a YouTube video of Rodrigo y Gabriela</p><p><br></p>

It's not April fools any more, but with the rumors floating around, it

announce a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070401-emi-to-announced-drm-free-plans-tomorrow-reports.html">DRM-free deal with EMI</a>.&nbsp; While hypebot is reporting that <a href="http://hypebot.typepad.com/hypebot/2007/04/has_amazon_boug.html">Amazon is about to buy eMusic</a>.&nbsp; Both rumors, if true will be significant steps toward a DRM-free world of music.</p><p>&nbsp;<i>Update:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2007/press18.htm">DRM-Free music from EMI at $1.29 per song is confirmed</a>. </i><b>W00t!</b><br>&nbsp;<br></p>

				<p>Following on the heals of <a href="major_miner_music_lableing_game.html">Major Miner</a> is a new music labeling game called T<a href="http://www.listengame.org/">he Listen Game</a>
 - in the Listen Game, you work to try to pick the best label for a 
music clip in a way that agrees with others. The more you agree, the 
more points you get. The game is fun, a bit addicting, and the data that
 they collect is used to improve music retrieval.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
game does have a few&nbsp; glitches (what do you do when your goal is to
 label the vocals and there are no vocals?), but all in all it was fun 
way to spend a lunch hour (I played more rounds that I ought to have, 
trying to break 500).&nbsp; </p><p>The Listen Game was put together by MIR researcher Douglas Turnbull.&nbsp; You can read more info about the project on hi<a href="http://cosmal.ucsd.edu/cal/projects/AnnRet/AnnRet.php">s research page</a>.<br></p><p>With
 all of these researchers looking at social tags I have a feeling we are
 going to see a lot of folksonomic papers at ISMIR .&nbsp; In fact I 
suggest that we change the name of ISMIR this year to "Isn't Social 
Music Incredibly Rad!"&nbsp; </p><p><img src="support_files/listengame.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"><br></p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p>
