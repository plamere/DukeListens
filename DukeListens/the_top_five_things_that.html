<b>#5 - Amazon didn't launch a music store. &nbsp; - </b>Early in 2006 the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://users1.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB114005222162375368.html">reported</a>
 that Amazon was getting ready to open a digital music store to compete 
with the almighty iTunes.&nbsp; According to the WSJ, Amazon would offer
 an all-you-can-eat subscription service and a branded Amazon player 
from Samsung, with a scheduled store launch in the summer of 2006.&nbsp;
  Well, Summer came and went - with no sign of the music store. Jeff 
Bezos - head of the Amazon empire was heard remarking that Amazon would 
not get into the music business until they could figure out what they 
could do that would be different than all of the other offerings out 
there.&nbsp; Now <a href="http://hypebot.typepad.com/hypebot/2006/12/amazon_to_enter.html">rumors</a>
 are that Amazon is planning on launching the store as early as March 
2007.&nbsp; I'm excited about this - really excited. Here's why:</p><ul><li><b>MP3s -&nbsp; </b>Rumor
 is that the Amazon store will sell music that is not DRM laden -meaning
 that the songs will play in any device without restriction.&nbsp; The 
Amazon store may be the first big step toward the<a href="http://digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com/2007/01/06/cringely-says-drm-doomed-in-2007-so-is-zune/"> death of DRM</a>. This is also good news for anyone trying to do content-based recommendation - systems like those used by <a href="http://www.musicip.com/">MusicIP</a>
 that analyze the content of the music don't work when the music is 
protected by DRM.&nbsp; Likewise researchers in the Music Information 
Retrieval community working on problems such as automatic music 
classification, beat detection,&nbsp; thumbnailing, summarization, etc. 
will be able to work with Amazon supplied MP3s - something that they 
can't do with the billions of tracks that have been purchased from 
iTunes.</li><li><b>Subscription model -&nbsp; </b>It is hard to square 
an all-you-can-eat subscription model with DRM-free MP3s -&nbsp; so I am
 a bit skeptical that Amazon would offer this - but still, it is 
interesting to think about an Amazon-branded music player coupled with 
such a music subscription service.&nbsp; The mobile phone model would 
seem to work well here - Amazon could offer a free Amazon music player 
with a 2-year music subscription.&nbsp; The music player could be one of
 the nano-esque Samsung players that look very nice.<br></li></ul><blockquote><blockquote><img src="support_files/sams_k3.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br></blockquote></blockquote><ul><li><b>Discovery -&nbsp; </b>Amazon's
 focus on discovery makes Amazon a much better online bookstore than any
 other bookstore.&nbsp; They use all sorts of ways to connect a reader 
with a book.&nbsp; Collaborative filtering, book reviews, customer 
lists,&nbsp; content search,&nbsp; best seller lists , special 
deals.&nbsp; These techniques help get their readers deep into the long 
tail of books.&nbsp; Discovery is in Amazon's genes.&nbsp; When they 
start selling digital music, you can bet that they will have the same 
focus on discovery and give the listener new and interesting ways to 
find music in the long tail.&nbsp; A listener may come to Amazon to pick
 up the latest U2 track, but may find themselves happily downloading a 
track by an obscure artist.&nbsp; This is good for the listener - they 
will will be exposed to a larger variety of music and this is good for 
the long tail artists.</li><li><b>Metadata - </b>Amazon has a great set 
of web services built around their data.&nbsp; Using Amazon's web 
services, one can get access to book descriptions, book cover images, 
reviews, pricing information - just about&nbsp; any piece of data&nbsp; 
in Amazon's database is exposed via their web services.&nbsp; Exposing 
their data in this fashion places Amazon at the center of the online 
literary ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any startup company that wants to be in a
 business related to books will&nbsp; use Amazon's API&nbsp; because it 
is easy, the data is of high quality and it is free.&nbsp; This is good 
for the startup, and even better for Amazon since all of those startups 
end up sending their customers to Amazon.&nbsp; Amazon is already a big 
part of the music ecosystem.&nbsp; They already have lots of data for 
music CDs that is available via their web APIs.&nbsp; They are probably 
the largest supplier of album art on the web.&nbsp; The Amazon part 
number - the ASIN - is used throughout the web as an unambiguous 
identifier for an album. Once Amazon starts to sell individual tracks, I
 would expect that Amazon will create an ASIN or an equivalent for each 
track in their database.&nbsp; This track-level identifier may become 
the primary way of identifying tracks in the music world since Amazon 
makes it so easy to get all of the information about an item once you 
have the ASIN.&nbsp; This could be a key enabler in the next generation 
of music - a&nbsp; ubiquitous song ID tied to deep metadata.</li><li><b>Variable pricing - </b>Instead
 of $0.99 per track Amazon will set the price of a song related to its 
popularity and freshness.&nbsp; There's no reason that a track that 
sells only a few copies a year should sell for the same price as the 
latest chart topper.&nbsp; Sites like <a href="http://amiestreet.com/welcome">Amie Street</a>
 are already demonstrating that variable pricing models can be a really 
interesting part of the discovery process and an important business 
model.<br></li><li><b>Brand -&nbsp; </b>The Amazon brand is well known 
and liked (at least in the U.S) - this gives them a big step up over 
companies like Microsoft (that has a less than stellar reputation in 
some <a href="https://slashdot.org/">circles)</a> and eMusic (which is not well known outside of the music geek world).&nbsp; <br></li></ul><p>So
 Amazon has a lot going for it.&nbsp; Now let me offer a few suggestions
 to the folks building the Amazon music store that will make a big 
difference to the digital music world:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<b>ASIN &lt;--&gt; MBID</b> - provide a web service that will map between ASINs and MusicBrainz IDs.&nbsp; <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>
 is a community music metadatabase that provides all sorts of 
interesting music metadata for artists, albums and songs.&nbsp; An MBID 
is the MusicBrainz ID that is associated with a track, album or 
artist.&nbsp; If there's an easy bridge between the Amazon metadata and 
the MusicBrainz data, the value of both databases will be enhanced.</li><li><b>Use XSPF </b>- <a href="http://xspf.org/">XSPF</a>
 is an emerging xml-based playlist format that is designed to encourage 
playlist sharing and portability.&nbsp; XSPF is simple, portable and 
open. By adopting the XSPF format Amazon would&nbsp; increase the 
visibility and use of this format leading to its wide adoption as <i>the</i> way of representing playlists.</li><li><b>Don't DRM the 30 second clips - </b>There
 are lots of&nbsp; people in the research and in the commercial world 
that are doing interesting things with audio - things like content-based
 recommendation, mood classification, beat tracking, music 
visualization.&nbsp; A common problem for these folks is getting access 
to the audio - especially for new music. It is expensive to build a 
research collection around new music - and after a couple of years the 
research collection is no longer new.&nbsp; If Amazon provided a way to 
turn an ASIN into a 30 second snippet of a song (even a low quality 
excerpt), they would enable a whole new generation of content-based 
music research - that would ultimately lead to a much more interesting 
set of tools for exploring and interacting with music.</li></ul>So .. 
yes, I'm bullish on Amazon in the music space.&nbsp; Amazon's emphasis 
on discovery, their willingness to provide access to their metadata and 
their rejection of DRM give them the ability to compete with the 
all-mighty iTunes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course a year from now, I may be
 writing once again about Amazon in the "Top things that didn't happen 
in 2007" blog entry - but I think that&nbsp; in 2007 we may see the 
tipping point for digital music and Amazon may be at the center of it 
all.<br><p><br><br></p>

                They didn't close down <a href="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/Allof.html" mp3.com="" rel="nofollow">AllofMP3.com</a>
 (not that they didn't try hard). 

The solution is apparently different from prosecuting and closing down, 
someone is yet to come up with a solution that would be as widely 
acceptable as buying vinyl was in the period 1920-1970 or buying CDs was
 between 1985 - 1995. In those periods this was respectively the way to <i>get</i> and <i>keep</i> music and, although alternatives existed, they were marginal and didn't cause conflicts in the value chain.

Note the keywords 'get' and 'keep'. I believe there are only (very) few <i>fundamental</i> things that people ever do with music:
- <b>make</b> (compose, play,produce)
- <b>get</b> (buy or obtain free, in any form from sheet music and live listening to audio downloads)
- <b>keep</b> (store for subsequent use in any analog/digital form)
- <b>enjoy</b> (experience, listen to - but also view, read about)
- <b>share</b> (during any of the previous - when making, keeping or 
enjoying)

Historically the chain between these was linear with clearly defined 
roles and one-to-one relationships between those roles (or one-to-many, 
e.g. between make - experience).

Today's connected world, however is essentially <i>many-to-many</i> and 
all roles hugely overlap. The maker of music is a sharer as is the 
recipient (listener), who is also often a maker etc. This causes the 
economic conflicts and a good workable model is yet to be found.

I can predict it won't happen in 2007...
