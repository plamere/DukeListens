	<div class="entry-content">
				I've done a few more updates to the <a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/SXSWArtistCatalog/">SXSW Artist catalog</a>.
  I've spent quite a bit of time working on improving data quality - 
trying to make sure that we maximize the chance that an artist will be 
resolved properly.  Most of the problems had to do with dealing with 
international characters, HTML entities and encodings. After a bit of 
work, I've reduced the mismatches so that we can now resolve 1136 of 
1168 artists (&gt; 97%).
<p>
<img src="support_files/_sxsw-map3.png" alt="sxsw-map3.png" border="0">  
</p><p>
I've added a '<a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/SXSWArtistCatalog/sxsw_new.html">Newest</a>'
 page that shows artists that have been recently added to the list by 
SXSW. I've also added an artist patch up mechanism that lets me easily 
fix data for an artist if it is wrong.  I've already used it too - the 
band <a href="http://www.sonicbids.com/HotKicks">The Hot Kicks</a> send me some updated info that I was able to apply with the patch mechanism.
And finally, I've added a link that will show you Flickr images of the artist.

			<h3><a href="adding_google_maps_to_the.html" title="permalink">Adding Google maps to the SXSW Artist Catalog</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Today, I added another option to my <a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/SXSWArtistCatalog/index.html">SXSW Artist Catalog</a>.
  In addition to browsing artists by popularity or tag, you can now 
browse artists via a Google map.  Artists are shown on the map as 
markers - clicking on a marker shows you details about the artist and 
lets you listen to the Artist on Last.fm or Youtube.
<p>
<a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/SXSWArtistCatalog/sxsw_map.html"><img src="support_files/_sxsw-map2.png" alt="sxsw-map2.png" border="0" height="784" width="495"></a>
</p><p>
The map shows just how global the SXSW music festival really is, with 
bands coming from all over the world.  There are bands from as far north
 as Iceland, and from as far south as New Zealand.  There are artists 
from Iran, Uganda, Nigeria, the Canary Islands, and a hundred from the 
NYC area. I find that it is fun to explore for music in this way. I'll 
see a band in some far flung place like Laramie Arizona, and wonder what
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naoD4dWDVi0">kind of music</a> I'd find there.</p><p>
This was my first time using the Google maps API.  I never realized how 
powerful and flexible the API is. One of the tricks that you can do with
 the API is to use a MarkerManger to control how many markers are 
visible at any particular zoom level. Without this, I would be trying to
 display over a thousand markers at once, which will hobble many 
browsers. 
</p><p>
One issue, we only have city-level resolution for artists, so when you 
look at a city like London or NYC, there may be 100s of artists at a 
single point.  To deal with this, I randomly dither the lat/longs for 
artists that collide with others, so each artist appears at a distinct 
location.  The downside of course, is that some artists will appear in 
strange places like the Hudson river (and as far as I know, the only 
artist who has actually appeared in the Hudson is <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/01/16/2009-01-16_australian_songwriter_emma_sophina_sings.html">Emma Sophina</a>,
 and I don't think she's going to SXSW). Despite this, the dithering 
works pretty well - here's a zoom in on the NYC area.  Without the 
dithering, you'd only see one marker. 
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_sxsw-map1.png" alt="sxsw-map1.png" border="0" width="500">
</p><p>
There are a few errors - for instance the band 
"paté de fuá"  appear in Maine and not Mexico city - this is because the band is listed as being from "Mexico City <b>ME</b>" on the <a href="http://sxsw.com/music/shows/bands">SXSW site</a>
 - and believe it or not, there is a Mexico Maine.  Probably over the 
next few days, I'll add a patch-up mechanism to make it easy to fix 
these sorts of errors.

</p><p>
This has been a fun little project - I really enjoy playing with all of 
these APIs to build something that might be useful for others.  I'd love
 to hear feedback and suggestions - so feel free to send them my way.

  I'm especially looking forward to seeing and hearing  some of the 
thousand-plus musicians and bands that will be playing this year at the 
festival.  
This week, the SXSW organizers posted the <a href="http://sxsw.com/music/shows/bands"> official list of 2009 artists</a>  with 1200 or so bands   with links to their  home pages. Here's the head of the list:
<p>
<a href="http://sxsw.com/music/shows/bands"><img src="support_files/_sxsw-showcase.png" alt="sxsw-showcase.1.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>

 I found the list incredibly daunting - I had not heard of most of the 
artists - how would I figure out which ones I wanted to see?  I could 
imagine   me sitting in a hotel room all week in Austin paralyzed by the
 many options.
</p><p>
I decided to deal with this problem directly - I just needed to add some
 context to this list - some photos, a little bio, some social tags, 
links to music and videos.  If I had all that I could more easily pick 
the bands that I wanted to see.  And so that's what I did. Using 
Last.fm's and Youtube's web services, I've created my own version of the
 SXSW Artist catalog that fills in all of the missing context.  With the
 catalog, I can browse the artists alphabetically, by popularity and by 
tag.  Here's an example:
</p><p>
<a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/SXSWArtistCatalog/index.html"><img src="support_files/_guide-pop.png" alt="guide-pop.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
Now, with the catalog, I can, for instance, find all of the bands that have been tagged with "<a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/SXSWArtistCatalog/mathrock.html">math rock</a>" (there are currently 14 of them), audition them, look at their videos and decide which ones I want to see (<a href="http://www.ecstaticsunshine.com/">Ecstatic Sunshine</a> looks interesting).
</p><p> Building the catalog was fun.  I decided to keep it as simple as
 possible, just a set of static HTML pages that get updated offline. No 
AJAX, no servlets, nothing but HTML. By keeping it simple, I was able to
 create the whole thing in a day. Getting all the data was pretty easy 
too. It is amazing what you can do with the web services at places like 
Last.fm and Youtube.  It would have been impossible to build this sort 
of site 5 years ago.  
</p><p>I've put the catalog online - perhaps others will find it useful too. Feel free to check out  <a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/SXSWArtistCatalog/">Paul's SXSW Artist Catalog</a>.

Recked is an informal event for engineers interested in recommender 
systems. This technology has proven its success for businesses like 
Amazon, Google, Last.fm and Netflix, and now new startups are using it 
to shape their products.
</p><p>
Held on January 26 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Recked will focus on 
how to implement collaborative filtering for your product in a 
manageable and practical way. Three experienced speakers will give you 
all the real-world use cases and solutions you'll need to start building
 your own recommendation platform.

				The folks over at Last.fm have added an <a href="http://playground.last.fm/eventmap">experimental event mapper</a>
 that will show nearby events that you might be interested in on a 
google map.  Since Last.fm knows what kind of music I like, they can map
 upcoming shows of artists that I've listened to on map. It's pretty 
neat - here's my map:

<a href="http://support_files/_lastfmmap.png"><img src="support_files/_lastfmmap.png" alt="lastfmmap.png" border="0" width="500"></a>

I really like this and I hope they extend this into the long tail. It'd 
be really neat if they could improve their event recommender to find the
 long tail artists that are playing in my neighborhood that I would 
like.  It looks like their event recommender is only showing artists 
that I've already listened to (but I could be wrong). It'd be really 
helpful if their event recommender would point me to artists playing 
locally that I haven't heard, but might like.

				In their final year project,  <a href="http://visualizinglastfm.de/index.html">Monitoring and Visualizing Last.fm</a>,
 Christopher Adjei and Mils Holland-Cunz use data from Last.fm to create
 visualizations that help identify new music trends as they spread 
around the world.  This is one of the more stunning sets of 
visualizations of last.fm data that I've seen.

				<a href="https://flickr.com/photos/patetiiko/1326657871/"><img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="support_files/1326657871_b1a1a0f7c8_m.jpg"></a> Go to last.fm and search for<a href="https://www.last.fm/tag/emo"> tag emo</a>
 and Last.fm will happily show you that the top emo bands are Fall Out 
Boy, My Chemical Romance, Jimmy Eat World, Brand New, Death Cab for 
Cutie and Taking Back Sunday.  Pretty easy right? Next, go to the 
Wikipedia and look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emo_artists">List of Emo Artists</a>
 - they have a list of 75 or so bands that have 'been referred to as, or
 had their music described as emo'. Again, that seems to be pretty 
straightforward.  But emo is not so simple.  Just take a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_emo_artists">Wiki discussion page for the list of emo artists</a>
 - you'll find a debate as vigorous and vitriolic as the great emacs vs.
 vi debate of the 80s, the paper vs. plastic debate of the 90s and the 
Gervais vs. Carell debate of 00s all put together.
<p> Some excerpts:

</p><ul>
<li> Emo is chaotic music. Emo is a form of hardcore punk. Emo is 
closely related to screamo. Pop rock is not. Who started this whole emo 
thing? Rites of Spring. Neon White, go listen to Rites of Spring. Tell 
me the difference between them and Panic! At the Disco. They just don't 
sound anything alike. I like all music, and pop rock, but I have enough 
sense to know that their is a huge line between emo, and mainstream 
music. Therefore, Wikipedia itself, is unreliable
</li><li>hm.... im a bit puzzled here... the article is named "list of 
emo band", yet there's not a single emo band in the entire list....
</li><li>My Chemical Romance is not emo. Alexisonfire is not emo, Fall 
Out Boy? just posers. Real emo music is emocore emo violence, screamo, 
emopunk, indie/emorock
</li><li>all Out Boy May not be emo but they are not possers
</li><li>THREE DAYS GRACE not!!!! emo!!! they are POST GRUNGE!!!!
</li><li> MCR IS NOT EMO
</li></ul>
<p>
And the discussion just goes on and on.  People can't agree what emo is.
