			<h2>Sleevenotez - The ÜberMashup</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>A few months ago, I had one of those 'oh crap!' moments - I was working on <a href="http://snappradio.com/">Snapp Radio</a>, my mashup of music and photos - when someone sent me an email with that contained just a URL: <a href="http://www.sleevenotez.com/">http://www.sleevenotez.com/.</a>&nbsp;
 I took&nbsp; a quick look at their site and saw to my increasing dread 
that they were making a mashup that seemed to be very similar to Snapp 
Radio - while you listen to music they would show related information 
about what you were listening to.&nbsp; Looking a little closer - I 
realized that what sleevenotez was doing is very different than Snapp 
Radio - Snapp Radio is a <i>lean-back</i> interface - it is meant to be 
something that you enjoy in the background - sort of a relaxing backdrop
 to your music - something you could use while you are <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bond/entry/schnapps_radio_-_woah_i">taking a bath</a> whereas sleevenotez is a <i>lean-forward</i> type of interface - something you use when you want to be actively engaged with your music.<br></p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.sleevenotez.com/"><img src="support_files/sleeve.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Sleevenotez is a music companion website. Their byline is '<i>reatime info for your digital music'.</i>&nbsp;
 While you listen to music Sleevenotez will scurry off to various 
corners of the web to collect information about the artist and song you 
are listening too, and display it - providing a single page that gives 
you just about everything you'd want to know about an artist.&nbsp; 
Sleevenotez currently shows you:</p><ul><li><b>Artist biography </b>- from the wikipedia</li><li><b>Discography -&nbsp; </b>from MusicBrainz</li><li><b>CDs for Sale -&nbsp; </b>from Amazon</li><li><b>Photos of the artists - </b>from Flickr</li><li><b>Videos of the artists - </b>from YouTube</li><li><b>Lyrics for the song - </b>from Lyrc.com.ar</li></ul><p>Sleevenotez
 determines what your are currently listening to using the last.fm 
audioscrobbler 'now playing' feed.&nbsp; Thus there are a total 7 
services combined by sleevenotez to build the artist/song page.&nbsp; 
You can also use sleevenotez to quickly aggregate information about an 
artist even if you are not listening to a song - they have an easy to 
understand URL syntax - so its easy to just plug in a URL like<a href="http://www.sleevenotez.com/artist/weezer"> http://www.sleevenotez.com/artist/weezer</a> to bring up all of the information about Weezer.</p><p>The
 Sleevenotez team have an excellent design sense - they have all of the 
Web 2.0 design goodness - pleasing color selections, curved borders, 
killer logo,&nbsp; fading transitions - it is really quite a slick 
interface - very polished for an alpha release - a very pleasing 
experience all the way around. The information that they present is well
 organized,&nbsp; tt's&nbsp; not overdone, there's no ajax for ajax sake
 - the sleevenotez teams shows they have great design chops.<br></p><p> <img src="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/support_files/title_button.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br></p><p>Sleevenotez
 is an alpha and as such there are a few problems.&nbsp; The biggest 
problem right now is that the 'realtime info' is delayed by several 
minutes - if you are listening to a song, the info for the song doesn't 
appear until the song is nearly over.&nbsp; This is an unfortunate side 
effect of using the last.fm web audioscrobbler web service - tracks are 
only scrobbled by the scrobbler when they have played for at least a 
certain amount of time (usually at least 50%).&nbsp; The result is that 
sleevenotez is always behind by a couple of minutes.&nbsp; The 
sleevenotez team is well aware of this issue - and have a<a href="http://blog.sleevenotez.com/2006/10/forward_ever_backward_never.html"> plan to fix</a> this (but this relies on some changes in how last.fm does things) that may take a while before this gets sorted out.</p><p>&nbsp;Sleevenotez
 does on occasion have some trouble finding the right data - sometimes 
it will show wrong information in the bio section - data about the 
Buddist notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana">trancendental happiness </a>instead of a biography of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_%28band%29">Seattle rock band</a>, or punt on the lyrics, or show non-related photos - it is hard to get this right - try finding photos on <a href="https://flickr.com/search/?q=blur&amp;w=all">Flickr for the band 'blur'</a> - but since this is an alpha, we can cut sleevenotez some slack, I'm sure they'll improve this over time.<br></p><p>Ultimately
 sleevenotez may have a bigger problem with their business model - many 
of the webservices that they rely on - last.fm and flickr for instance -
 have <i>terms-of-service</i> that allow for non-commercial use of the 
services. Sooner or later sleevenotez may start making money with their 
site - via Amazon referrers or advertising (they may already be doing 
that now) - when that happens they'll have to make commercial 
arrangements with their data providers to avoid violating the 
terms-of-service - and that may be quite difficult.&nbsp; For now, most 
companies are content to look the other way and let people mashup their 
data - its all part of growing an ecosystem around one's data - it 
certainly can help companies like last.fm for instance if alternative 
interfaces spring up that ultimately drive people to use the last.fm 
plugin - but last.fm may also get a bit chuffed if a site like 
sleevenotez starts to siphon away Amazon referrers - it would only take a
 'cease-and-desist' letter from a last.fm lawyer (or do they call them 
solicitors over there?) to make the house of cards come tumbling 
down.&nbsp; </p><p>The sleevenotez team has been blogging about 
sleevenotez development - they are agile developers and have even gone 
so far as to put some of their agile process data in their blog - here's
 <a href="http://blog.sleevenotez.com/2006/08/iteration_1_is_over.html">iteration #1.</a> I&nbsp; like that open development model.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm
 really excited to see sleevenotez - it's a great mashup - and a very 
useful music companion.&nbsp; I'm guessing the sleevenotez team will 
continue to add more data to set of info shown for an artist and song - 
album reviews, related artists, social tags, playlists,&nbsp; upcoming 
concerts - anything you'd want to know about an artist.&nbsp; Once they 
get the alpha kinks out of the system - the scrobbler-delay - and the 
misguided data&nbsp; - sleevenotez will be one of the best ways to learn
 more about the artists that perform our favorite music.&nbsp; It will 
be interesting too, to see how they navigate through the uncharted legal
 territory of trying to build&nbsp; a business on top of mashup 
webservices. <br></p>

                <p>Thanks for the lovely write up!  I particularly like the <i>lean-back</i> vs. <i>lean-forward</i> idea.  I hadn't really considered Sleevenotez in those terms.</p>

<p>Personally (I can't talk for the others on the Sleevenotez team) I'm 
obsessed with the idea of Partial Continuous Attention; the idea that 
like email you are always keeping an eye on it, only to be fully engaged
 when something happens that you want or need.</p>

<p>Your comments regarding legality are also right on the money (and, 
yes, they're called solicitors here)...  At the moment we are very 
careful to only use the data strictly according to the terms of use, 
which is why there is no advertising or affiliate linking within the 
site.</p>

<p>At some point we will need to deal with this, but for the moment we are happy to prove what's <i>possible</i>; proving what's <i>viable</i> is a problem for another day.</p>

Actually, if they are providing a service whereby a user of Last.fm is 
using their own data feeds for 'anything,' it would be ok by Last.fm's 
terms. Each user of Last.fm has full rights to their data. 

Now, if this service harvested data from Last.fm in some type of 
aggregate manner, or was not querying feeds on behalf of a Last.fm user,
 then yes, Last.fm could put an end to it.

Some of the MusicBrainz data is Public Doman, but other portions of the 
data does come with a license, and I'm sure there are some other 
restrictions on Flickr.

I've been working on mashing Last.fm data with Amazon and MusicBrainz 
for a site/project, and recently looked over the terms of each service.

have a good one,
Gideon
