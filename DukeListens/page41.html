				<p>This <a href="http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/362365/emi-records-partners-with-last-fm-to-encourage-music-exploration.html">press release</a>
 describes a partnership between EMI and last.fm in which EMI has 
launched ‘tuneglue-audiomap,’ an "extensive online music mapping 
mechanism
which utilizes data from Last.fm to make focused and
accurate music recommendations to music fans.".&nbsp; As I write this, 
there doesn't seem to be any site beyond a holding page at <a href="http://audiomap.tuneglue.net/">http://audiomap.tuneglue.net/</a> so it looks like the press release is a bit premature. So there's nothing to report about the site yet. <br></p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://blog.formater.de/">Hannes</a> points me to<a href="http://clients.onyro.com/tuneglue/"> http://clients.onyro.com/tuneglue/</a> to see tuneglue in action.&nbsp; It appears to be a reworking of <a href="http://www.dimvision.com/musicmap/">MusicMap</a>
 with some nifty interface improvements and of course incorporating the 
last.fm similarity data.&nbsp; Here's tuneglue in action:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="support_files/tuneglue.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="95%"><br></p><p>&nbsp;It's a pretty cool way to browse through the world of music.&nbsp; It is similar to <a href="http://www.liveplasma.com/">MusicPlasma</a> and <a href="http://www.musicovery.com/">Musicovery </a>in
 that you have a visual way of exploring similar artists - it would be 
nice of tuneglue would let you listen to music like Musicovery does.<br></p><p>It is interesting to see one of the big labels&nbsp; starting to work with last.fm.&nbsp; It sure did take them long enough.<br></p>

 documenting the effects of radio station ownership consolidation on 
musicians and the public.&nbsp; The report sharply criticizes the trend 
to radio consolidation stating: </p><blockquote><p><i>Radio consolidation has no demonstrated benefits for the public.&nbsp; Nor
does it have any demonstrated benefits for the working people of the
music and media industries, including DJs, programmers—and musicians.&nbsp;
The Telecom Act unleashed an unprecedented wave of radio mergers that
left a highly consolidated national radio market and extremely
consolidated local radio markets.&nbsp; Radio programming from the largest
station groups remains focused on just a few formats—many of which
overlap with each other, enhancing the homogenization of the airwaves</i>.</p></blockquote><p>A
 chart showing the market share for the largest radio networks shows 
that the top 4 networks now have 50% marketshare - and the largest 
networks are narrowing the range of programming<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="support_files/radiostudy06listenerpie.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p><p>The<a href="http://www.futureofmusic.org/research/radiostudy06execsum.cfm"> executive summary</a> is an interesting read for anyone that is interested in the future of music on broadcast radio.</p><p><br></p>

about technology in 1991, a communications technology that makes you
forget that the communications taking place are being assisted by
technology: and a rocket science-like technology at that. It was a real
glimpse into a future where technology is a seamless and transparent
part of what we do, rather than something that requires a lot of
frustrating knobs and levers to make it do our bidding.</i></p><p>Dave's
 right, the Collaborative Environments team has put together a really 
compelling system for improving distributed meetings.&nbsp; The folks on
 this team are&nbsp; hyper-creative&nbsp; and execute really well - not 
only do they put together a good demo - but the systems that they build 
are solid - not pieced together with glue and duct tape like many 
demos.&nbsp; <br></p>

				<p>Music 2.0 is really a silly term.&nbsp; If there's such a thing 
as Music 2.0 it probably occurred many thousands of years ago - when the
 first vocal group went from singing <i>tutti - </i>to singing in 
harmony, or perhaps Music 2.0 officially began when a human voice was 
accompanied for the first time by a tuned drum.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we 
need to label this new movement in the online music world - and since it
 seems to be part of the Web 2.0 era, these new online sites are called 
Music 2.0. &nbsp;</p><p>Music 2.0 sites fall into a number of camps: </p><ul><li>music services - places like iTunes and Rhapsody where you can purchase or subscribe to music</li><li>Music discovery - places that help you find music -&nbsp; these fall generally into 3 subcategories:</li><ul><li>Social - wisdom of the crowds sites like last.fm, iLike. Goombah and Qloud</li><li>Content-based - recommendations&nbsp; based on the music content - Pandora, SoundFlavor, MusicIP <br></li><li>Expert based - Music recommendations from people - music blogs, irateradio.com<br></li></ul><li>Music
 experience augmentation - sites to make your music listening experience
 more enjoyable - this includes playlisting sites like MusicMobs,&nbsp; 
fiql and Webjay - music dashboards like sleevenotez or Snapp Radio</li><li>Music meta data&nbsp; - add to the data surrounding the music - MusicBrainz, All Music Guide, Gracenote</li></ul>There are many other types too - it's hard to categorize them all.<br><p>Keeping
 track of what is going on in the Music 2.0 world is hard. It seems that
 every week there's a new Music 2.0 site that does something new and 
different.&nbsp; There are a few online lists that try to capture all of
 the Music 2.0 companies.&nbsp; There's Musick in the head's list of <a href="https://globallistic.blogspot.com/2006/12/music-20-companies.html">Music 2.0 Companies </a>and there's this <a href="http://soundblog.spaces.live.com/Lists/cns%21D380EA83E108537F%21310/">Music Matrix</a>
 from Dave's imaginary sound space that is a directory that seems to be 
mostly about social tagging as applied to music.&nbsp; In order to keep 
track of this ever expanding space I'd love to build a detailed living 
directory of all of the music 2.0 companies.&nbsp; Not just a list of 
the companies, but a detailed directory including:</p><ul><li>Detailed description of the site that describes all of the features<br></li><li>The reach (estimated number of users)</li><li>Descriptions of web services offered (if any)</li><li>The catalog size (where applicable the number of songs managed)</li></ul><p>It
 would be great to have such a directory, but building the directory 
seems like a huge job - one that I don't think I'd have time to do by 
myself.&nbsp; This, however, may be a perfect task for the wikipedia 
model - where lots of people contribute the content. I know that there 
are a number of folks that are interested in music 2.0 who read this 
blog. If you think you would be interested in contributing to a 
wikipedia page on Music 2.0 send me an email at Paul.Lamere [at] 
sun.com.&nbsp; If enough people offer to help, we'll get started on 
building the Ultimate Music 2.0 Directory.<br></p>

 is a music search engine.&nbsp; It crawls the web for&nbsp; MP3s, 
indexes them (it peeks inside the MP3 to pull out the ID3 tags like 
artist, album, genre, length and bitrate), and makes them available for 
search.&nbsp; The search itself, is very Google-esque.&nbsp; A simple 
search form&nbsp; - just in the name of a song, artist or album and 
MP3Realm will give you results that match - formatted to show what you 
need to know:&nbsp; the artist, album and title, genre, track length, 
the source host and probably most important - the link status - letting 
you know if the&nbsp; link is still a live link to real data.</p><p>MP3Realm
 currently has over 2 million tracks in its index - this sounds like a 
lot of tracks but&nbsp; many of them are dups or partial tracks - on the
 other hand, they seem to have lots of popular music - if you are 
looking for Wonderwall by Oasis - you'll find 20 different copies of the
 track at MP3Realm in various encodings.</p><p>MP3Realm relies on a 
provision of the DMCA to protect them from lawsuits by copyright holders
 - MP3Realm will take down any infringing links (they don't host any of 
the data) if they receive a <i>written</i> document sent by <i>Postal </i>mail.</p><p>MP3Realm
 is pretty neat - it is a quick way to find and download free music on 
the web.&nbsp; It has a much lower barrier to entry than the Kazaas and 
the various bittorrent clients.&nbsp; It is essentially Google for 
Mp3s.&nbsp; DMCA or no, I think MP3Realm's ease of use may be its 
downfall - the take down notices will come fast and furious once the 
RIAA machinery gets powered up.&nbsp; You can bet that the RIAA is also 
getting ready to argue, just as they did in the Grokster case, that 
MP3Realm is participating in contributory infringement because its does 
not meet the 'substantiality' requirement. If MP3Realm can show that it 
is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable purposes then it will be 
safe under the Sony safe-harbor principle.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; just a 
quick look through the MP3Realm shows that the majority of the tracks 
are under copyright. .</p><p>It may take sometime before the RIAA 
lawyers get on this - in the mean time, MP3Realm will be hooking people 
up with free digital music.&nbsp; The real victim here will be 
Apple.&nbsp; The same person who would buy a song from iTunes that they 
just heard on the radio can now just as easily go to MP3Realm and find 
the song and download it.&nbsp; It is easier and quicker in MP3Realm 
than it is in iTunes - and it doesn't cost $.99, and there's no 
DRM.&nbsp; If MP3Realm is around long enough it may turn a whole new set
 of people onto the idea that music should be free.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Seen on <a href="http://digg.com/music/MP3_Search_Engine_2">digg.com</a></i>&nbsp;</p>

discovery offerings such as iLike and Qloud, Goombah is not&nbsp; a web 
2.0, Ajax-laden web 2.0 app.&nbsp; Instead, it is a standalone app that 
you download, install and run (just like in them there olden days). 
Goombah uses your iTunes play history so don't bother trying Goombah if 
you are not an iTunes user. (Linux/Solaris folks are left out to dry - 
no iTunes, and no Goombah for us).&nbsp; The first time you run Goombah,
 you get a user/account name and go through the enrolling process. This 
takes about 20 minutes - during this time Goombah extracts info from 
your iTunes library, sends it back to the Goombah server where it churns
 through your collection (not the audio, just the artists, albums, songs
 and playcounts), builds a model for you so it can match you up with 
songs and similar users.&nbsp; Once this enrollment process is done, you
 are ready to use Goombah. &nbsp;</p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.goombah.com/images/press/screenshots/Goombah-RecommendedTracks.jpg"><img src="support_files/RecommendedTracks-thumb.html" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Goombah does 3 things for you:</p><ol><li>It gives you recommendations based upon your listening habits</li><li>It lets you browse the collections of other Goombah users, in particular similar users<br></li><li>It lets you download free music.</li></ol><p>The

of all, there were very few 'obvious' recommendations.&nbsp; They didn't
 recommend The Beatles, or U2 or Radiohead.&nbsp; There were no clunker 
recommendations (iLike is still telling me that I should try the <i>The Chimpmunk Song&nbsp; </i>by
 The Chimpmunks). And the recommendations that I previewed I actually 
liked - I found half-a-dozen songs that sounded really interesting that I
 hadn't heard before in just a few minutes with the recommender. <br></p><p>I
 did try to look at some of the users Goombah suggested would be similar
 to me.&nbsp; I found that the users didn't seem to be too similar. 
There's no 'compatibility score' like there is in iLike or last.fm - 
just an ordered list of similar users.&nbsp; I don't think Goombah has 
enough users yet to really hook me up with people with similar 
tastes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The users that I looked at, who were 'similar', 
didn't really share my music taste - and so I didn't find this feature 
too interesting. But, as the Goombah user base grows this could be more 
interesting.&nbsp; I do remember the old-time Napster, browsing another 
user's collection was my first online music discovery experience - I 
found lots of interesting music that way.</p><p>&nbsp;Goombah also 
recommends 'new, free music' that you can download. The tracks I tried 
were all keepers that I will be listening too again (much better than my
 hype-machine track record).&nbsp; </p><p>The Goombah app does have a 
few warts.&nbsp; It was slow to scroll through large collections of 
music.&nbsp; While it was downloading music, the Goombah app could do 
nothing but let&nbsp; watch the download progress bar.&nbsp; Every time I
 adjusted the 'Adventurous' setting, it insisted on putting up a rather 
annoying dialog box.&nbsp; The iTunes integration was a bit fragile 
-&nbsp; I could preview songs via iTunes, but sometimes I had to click 
two or three times to make it happen. Also, Goobah uses BitTorrent to 
download data from Goombah central to my computer - I'm not sure if I 
want to open up extra ports in my firewall to make it easier for Goombah
 .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these things (well, perhaps with the 
exception of the BitTorrent thing) can be expected in a&nbsp; new 
app.&nbsp; (They are not at version 1.0 yet).</p><p>&nbsp;I really like 
the simplicity of Goombah. It doesn't try to be a MySpace clone, it 
doesn't bother helping me send messages to people, it doesn't do 
tagging, album art, artist bios. It is just an app that I can use to get
 music recommendations -&nbsp; and they've really done a good job at 
giving me good recommendations.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

				Ringtones are a multi-billion dollar industry - for the phone, so 
NetStream is trying to hitch a ride on the ringtone gravy train by 
making a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006/11/29/netstreams-doorlinx-assign-an-mp3-to-your-doorbell/">doorbell with downloadable ringtones</a>
 - yes, the doorbell is an IP device with a network connection - there's
 something strangely appealing about pinging my doorbell, but nothing is
 appealing about hearing the Macarena when someone is at the door.

				<p>Back in October, I made&nbsp; the 6 hour trek to Montreal to 
attend the Future of Music Coalition Summit.&nbsp; It was a great event,
 with many interesting panels, and some very excellent hallway 
conversations.&nbsp; The hallway conversations have been lost to 
history, but you can catch the panel sessions (and avoid the tortuous

				<p><a href="http://taste.sourceforge.net/"><img src="support_files/Taste.png" style="float: left;" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>Recommendation
 is the next 'search'. Companies are trying hard to give people good 
recommendations - the web is becoming populated with music 
recommenders&nbsp; such as last.fm, myStrands, Qloud, and iLike. 
Companies like netflix are offering <a href="http://netflixprize.com/">million dollar prizes</a>
 for improved recommendations. &nbsp; If you are building a site with 
lots of content - whether it is music, video, blogs or dinner recipes - 
you will do well to include a recommender.&nbsp; But where to start? How
 does one go about building a recommendation engine?</p><p>&nbsp;One place to start is <a href="http://taste.sourceforge.net/">Taste</a> - Taste is a collaborative filtering engine for Java developed by <a href="https://srowen.blogspot.com/">Sean Owen</a>.&nbsp;
 Taste takes as input users' preferences for items&nbsp; and returns 
estimated preferences for other items.&nbsp; Taste includes a number of 
CF algorithms including Item-Item recommendations and user-based 
recommendations.&nbsp; </p><p>Taste is very well engineered with a very clean programming model.&nbsp; Here's an example of creating a <a href="http://www.daniel-lemire.com/fr/abstracts/SDM2005.html">Slope-One</a> Recommender:</p><blockquote><pre>DataModel model = new FileDataModel(new File("data.txt"));<br>Recommender recommender = new SlopeOneRecommender(model, true);<br></pre></blockquote><p>Using the recommender is as easy as:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><pre>List&lt;RecommendedItem&gt; recommendations = recommender.recommend(userID, 10);</pre></blockquote><p>There
 are a number of models and algorithms to try out. There's even a 
netflix data model so you can get a head start on the Netflix million 
dollar prize -&nbsp; Sean is competing already as his own team, but he 
doesn't mind if others use Taste to compete, in fact he encourages it. </p><p>Remember, if you don't have a recommendation engine on your site, you don't have Taste.<i> Seen on <font size="2"><a href="https://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/item-to-item-collaborative-filtering.html">Geeking With Greg</a>.</font></i></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Social music site <a href="http://www.qloud.com/">QLoud</a> has been redone - greatly simplifying the site.&nbsp; You can read about all the changes on the <a href="http://www.qloud.com/blog/">QLoud blog</a>. <br><br>They've
 also added Flickr images&nbsp; and YouTube videos that are related to 
the artist.&nbsp; It is interesting to see Qloud doing this sort of 
thing considering the recent post at Net, Blogs and Rock and Roll on <a href="http://www.netblogsrocknroll.com/2006/12/second_generati.html">Second Generation Websites</a>
 and the problems these sites have finding a viable business model when 
the terms-of-service such as Flickr's do not allow for commercial 
exploitation. At least in this iteration,&nbsp; QLoud seems to be saying
 F.U. to the Flickr <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/tos/">terms-of-service</a>
 - they don't give the photographers credit - they don't have the 
required links back to the flickr photo page and they violate licenses 
by showing 'all rights reserved' photos.&nbsp;  I don't think Qloud is 
willfully violating the TOS, I think it is just part of the web 2.0 
model of&nbsp; 'get things out the door as fast as you can', and worry 
about the legalities later.&nbsp; This model certainly worked for 
YouTube - I don't know if it will work for QLoud - it certainly did not 
work for the original Napster.&nbsp;</p>
