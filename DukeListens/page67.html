We package the <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/">Sphinx-4</a> demos as jar files. These can be easily run from the command line like so:

</p><pre>% java -jar HelloDigits.jar
</pre>
<p>
Now, some of our demos can be quite large and require a heap that is 
larger than the default heap size. To run these demos the user has to 
invoke the jar file with a -mx option like so:

</p><pre> % java -mx200m -jar HelloWorld.jar
</pre>

This is just bonkers.  Why should the user have to throw that switch? It
 is awkward for the user and requires more documentation by the 
developer.  Since the developer knows how much memory the program needs,
 let the developer configure the app, don't make the user do the work.  
<p>
Wouldn't it be great if you could put the Java command line options such
 as the "-mx200m" into the manifest in the jar file so it wouldn't be 
necessary to explicitly set the heap size option?  You can do this sort 
of thing with Java WebStart JNLP files, but there's no equivalent 
mechanism for simple jar files.  If we had this option we could 
eliminate a whole bunch of pesky documentation, make things easier for 
the user and reduce the possible failure modes for Java Apps.

Next week I'm giving a Sphinx-4 talk and demo.  The talk is
ready, but I still need a good demo.  Willie came up with an idea 
for a really cool demo, but it may not pan out, so I needed a backup
demo, just in case.
For a backup, I thought I would integrate our speech recognizer with a chess game.
The idea is that you can control the chess game with command like
"move the queen to A5" 
I figured there would be few open source all-Java chess demos out
there and I'd be able to find one that I could integrate with our
recognizer.
</p><p>
Indeed, I looked on SourceForge and FreshMeat and found a number of
them.  A couple of them wouldn't compile, a couple wouldn't run, one
looked really nice, but was too hard to figure out how to integrate
stuff into it (I had a budget of an afternoon to do it).  Finally I
settled in on <a href="http://jchessboard.sourceforge.net/">JChessBoard</a>. The code
was simple and fairly clean, and it was very easy to add the speech
recognizer to it.  Unfortunately, there were a number of nagging deadlocks 
caused by race conditions due to some improper updates of swing
components.  A few calls to SwingUtilities.invokeLater fixed this up
though. One really good thing about the JChessBoard app is that the
computer AI is pretty poor, so I have a fairly decent chance at beating
it.
</p><p>
I still have a bit of tuning to do, but it seems to work pretty well.
I'm getting very good recognition rates (using alpha, bravo, charlie
for those highly-confusable letters). So I guess I'll have something
to demo next week when/if the cool  demo doesn't work out.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>
In order for <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/">FreeTTS</a> to 
figure out how a word should be pronounced it first looks it up in an 
internal dictionary.  If the word is not in the dictionary then a set of
 letter-to-sound rules are applied to attempt to guess the 
pronunciation.  There's actually quite a bit of code in FreeTTS that is 
involved with determining the proper pronunciation based upon spelling. 
 Many people have wondered, if we  have such a set of letter-to-sound 
rules, why we need a dictionary at all. Well, in fact, the FreeTTS 
dictionary (which consists of 60,000 or so words) contains just the <b>exceptions</b>
 to the rules.  Spelling in English is just so irregular that even with 
1000 lines of Java code driving a state machine with 13,000 states in 
the letter-to-sound state machine, there are still 60 thousand spelling 
exceptions.  This state of affairs was highlighed by Gerard Nolst 
Trenite in the poem <a href="http://victorian.fortunecity.com/vangogh/555/Spell/chaos.html#chaos">The Chaos</a>. Here's an excerpt;
</p><p>

</p><blockquote>
<pre>Dearest creature in creation,
Studying English pronunciation,
        I will teach you in my verse
        Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse.
I will keep you, Susy, busy,
Make your head with heat grow dizzy;
        Tear in eye, your dress you'll tear;
        Queer, fair seer, hear my prayer.
Pray, console your loving poet,
Make my coat look new, dear, sew it! 
Strewn with stones like rowlock, gunwale,
        Islington, and Isle of Wight,
        Housewife, verdict and indict.
Don't you think so, reader, rather,
Saying lather, bather, father?       
        Finally, which rhymes with enough,
        Though, through, bough, cough, hough,
sough, tough??
Hiccough has the sound of sup.
My advice is:  GIVE IT UP!   
</pre>

Over at Microsoft's research lab, they've built a singing speech 
synthesiser.  You define a song in terms of lyrics and music (via MIDI),
 and Whistler will render the song with vocals. The example of 'Mark' 
singing Penny Lane sounds a lot like Kermit the frog.  
It doesn't look like you can download the program, nor does it look to 
be open source, so I guess all you can do for now is listen to the three
 audio samples. Still... it's pretty neat.

Much research has been done lately about 'talking head' simulations. 
These simulations attempt to present a realistic animation of a person 
while they are talking, such that the movement of the lips, and the 
visibility of the tongue give cues as to what is being said.  This can 
help hearing impaired as well as help the general listener improve 
understanding.
</p><p>
One talking head system developed at the University of Sheffield is described in the paper <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/graphics/publications/facial_animation/03imgbased.pdf">Image-based Talking Heads using Radial Basis Functions</a>.   More information about their research can be found on their <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/graphics/research/speechface/">Talking Heads Project Page</a>.  These folks are using <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/">FreeTTS</a> too.

I've taken a quick tour through a number of  music composition languages. I've settled in on <a href="http://jmusic.ci.qut.edu.au/">jMusic</a>.
 First, it is all Java so I don't have to learn or relearn another 
programming language. It is extendible so it should be possible to add 
support for CSound score files, and it supports MIDI and JavaSound out 
of the box, so I can hear what I am doing as I go along, and finally, it
 is an active project with good documentation.

Tuesday, we took a trip to one of our favorite places in the White Mountains: the <a href="http://hikenh.netfirms.com/TDBasCas.htm">Basin-Cascades</a>
 trail in Franconia Notch. The trail  parallels the Cascade Brook for 
about a mile or so.  We never walk the trail though, instead we walk up 
the brook in our bathing suits. The brook is a seemingly endless series 
of ice cold pools, potholes and waterfalls, perfect for cooling off on a
 hot day because no matter how hot it is, the water is very very cold. 
It takes a sturdy constitution to brave the water beyond the knee. Its a
 great place to go, but keep it secret.

Climbing the country music charts is <i>(I Wanna Hear) A Cheatin' Song</i>,
 a duet featuring Anita Cochran and Conway Twitty. Strange thing is, 
Conway Twitty died a decade before the song was written. Mr. Twitty did 
not sing the song from his grave. Instead, record producer Jim Ed Norman
 extracted 100's of snippets of Twitty's vocals from other recordings 
and painstakenly stitched them together using a computer program called 
Pro Tools, an audio production tool, to adjust pitch, smooth out the 
transitions and make it sound like a seemless recording.
</p><p>
In the future, as speech synthesis technology improves, the same thing 
could be done with actors voices,  allowing them to speak long after 
they have taken their last curtain call.  George Lucas could continually
 retinker with Darth Vader's lines long after James Earl Jones quits  in
 disgust. Ah well, maybe its not such a good idea.
</p><p>

				<p>
After my last <a href="page0.html">entry about talking robots </a>,
 researcher Alexander Koller, from the department of computational 
linguist at Universitat des Saarlandes in Germany pointed me to this 
course: <a href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/cl/courses/lego-04/">Talking Robots with LEGO MindStorms</a>. In this course, students build robots using <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/">Lego Mindstorms</a>, program them with Java (via Lejos) and control them via speech (using the Java Speech API).  
</p><p>
Last years crowd favorite was Luigi, the shell game player.
</p><p>

</p><p> 
There are <a href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/cl/courses/lego-02/projects.phtml">more pictures</a> of the final robots.
</p><p>
They've also written a <a href="http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/%7Ekoller/papers/lego.html">paper describing their work</a> and how Legos can be used by dialogue researchers to explore the robot-human interface.
</p><p>
I wish there had been courses like this when I was in school!
