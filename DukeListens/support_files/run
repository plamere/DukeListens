I've been posting to this blog for nearly 5 year starting with my first post on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/entry\/welcome_all\">May 3, 2004<\/a>. At that time, I was still working on speech engines, and the blog name was \"Duke Speaks!\". A month later, I wrote my first post that hinted at my interest in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/entry\/patent_idea_1\">music information retrieval<\/a>.\n<p>\nBlogging has been good to me. It serves as my backup memory. My nearly 50-year-old neurons may not remember everything, but I can usually remember if I've blogged about something, and a re-reading what I wrote refreshes my memory. So, for instance, if I can't remember the difference between the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/entry\/the_idiomag_api\">Idiomag API<\/a> and the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/entry\/the_yes_developer_api\">YES API<\/a>, I can just read what I wrote. <p>\nBlogging has been a great way to get connected with folks. When I write something about a new Music 2.0 startup, I'll often get an introductory email from the CEO or CTO of the company the next day - I have a pretty good virtual rolodex due to my blogging.\n<p>\nBlogging has helped me improve my writing. Writing something every day that will be read by a thousand or so people has been a good exercise. I'm not sure if my writing is any better than before I started blogging, but it certainly is faster. I used to have a real problem with writer's block (and I still do when it comes to writing papers), but now blog posts seem to flow much more easily. Blogging has also helped me improve my thinking. By writing down my ideas on a topic I'm forced to think things through.\n<p>\nBlogging has given me a thicker skin. On the Internet, people like to disagree and criticize -especially anonymously. I've received my share of criticism, some gentle, some harsh and some downright offensive, but after 5 years, the critics don't bother me to much, and I can just reject and delete the offensive ones.\n<p>\nSome stats for the blog:\n<table>\n<tr><td>Total posts <td> 1079\n<tr><td>Total comments<td> 1143\n<tr><td>Daily uniques <td> ~2,000\n<tr><td>Google reader subscribers: <td> > 300 <tr><td>Where readers live <td> 55 different countries\n<\/table>\n<p>\nI want to thank all of my loyal readers for visiting Duke Listens!. I especially want to thank the many folks who've contributed ideas and links. I especially want to thank Steve, Jeremy, Zac and Oscar who have been particularly faithful in providing me with blog fodder. <p>\nAnd so with that, I write my last post of Duke Listens! I hope you all will continue to follow me on <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/MusicMachinery.com\">Music Machinery<\/a>.

After 9 years, I've decided to move on to the next thing. During these last 9 year I've worked on some really fun projects and worked with some really smart, creative and interesting people. The work environment at Sun Labs is really special and I doubt that I shall ever experience anything like it again. Bob Sproull, the head of the labs believes that the best way to run the labs is to let the researchers work on the things that they are passionate about. Some companies have a practice called 'Friday Projects' where you can spend one day a week working on a project that you find interesting. For us in Sun Labs, every day is Friday.\n<p>\nWith this freedom, I've spent the last four years working on the problem of music recommendation and discovery. I've written lots of code, given lots of talks, presented demos, written papers, filed patents, gave interviews for reporters, dined with an astronaut, written lots of blog posts, and listened to lots and lots of music.\n<p>\nI've also made many friends, and saying goodbye is the hardest part of leaving, but I suspect that many of our paths will cross again.\n<p>\nThe labs is an extremely comfortable place to be. I could easily stay here for the rest of my working career and be quite happy and productive, but I have an itch to go and try to do something really great. I think I've found the place to go and do it, and so Tuesday is my last day at Sun, and Wednesday starts my new adventure.

In addition to browsing artists by popularity or tag, you can now browse artists via a Google map. Artists are shown on the map as markers - clicking on a marker shows you details about the artist and lets you listen to the Artist on Last.fm or Youtube.\n<p>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/research.sun.com:8080\/SXSWArtistCatalog\/sxsw_map.html\"><img src=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/resource\/_sxsw-map2.png\" alt=\"sxsw-map2.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"495\" height=\"784\"\/><\/a>\n<p>\nThe map shows just how global the SXSW music festival really is, with bands coming from all over the world. There are bands from as far north as Iceland, and from as far south as New Zealand. There are artists from Iran, Uganda, Nigeria, the Canary Islands, and a hundred from the NYC area. I find that it is fun to explore for music in this way. I'll see a band in some far flung place like Laramie Arizona, and wonder what <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=naoD4dWDVi0\">kind of music<\/a> I'd find there.<p>\nThis was my first time using the Google maps API. I never realized how powerful and flexible the API is. One of the tricks that you can do with the API is to use a MarkerManger to control how many markers are visible at any particular zoom level. Without this, I would be trying to display over a thousand markers at once, which will hobble many browsers. <p>\nOne issue, we only have city-level resolution for artists, so when you look at a city like London or NYC, there may be 100s of artists at a single point. To deal with this, I randomly dither the lat\/longs for artists that collide with others, so each artist appears at a distinct location. The downside of course, is that some artists will appear in strange places like the Hudson river (and as far as I know, the only artist who has actually appeared in the Hudson is <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/ny_local\/2009\/01\/16\/2009-01-16_australian_songwriter_emma_sophina_sings.html\">Emma Sophina<\/a>, and I don't think she's going to SXSW). Despite this, the dithering works pretty well - here's a zoom in on the NYC area. Without the dithering, you'd only see one marker. <p>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/resource\/_sxsw-map1.png\" alt=\"sxsw-map1.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\"\/>\n<p>\nThere are a few errors - for instance the band \"pat\u00e9 de fu\u00e1\" appear in Maine and not Mexico city - this is because the band is listed as being from \"Mexico City <b>ME<\/b>\" on the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/sxsw.com\/music\/shows\/bands\">SXSW site<\/a> - and believe it or not, there is a Mexico Maine. Probably over the next few days, I'll add a patch-up mechanism to make it easy to fix these sorts of errors. <p>\nThis has been a fun little project - I really enjoy playing with all of these APIs to build something that might be useful for others. I'd love to hear feedback and suggestions - so feel free to send them my way.","dc:creator":"plamere","y:title":"Adding Google maps to the SXSW Artist Catalog","category":"General","title":"Adding Google maps to the SXSW Artist Catalog","guid":{"isPermaLink":"true","content":"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/entry\/adding_google_maps_to_the"},"pubDate":"Mon, 19 Jan 2009 07:54:38 -0800","y:published":{"hour":"15","timezone":"UTC","second":"38","month":"1","minute":"54","utime":"1232380478","day":"19","day_of_week":"1","year":"2009"}},{"link":"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/entry\/my_sxsw_artist_guide","y:id":{"value":"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/entry\/my_sxsw_artist_guide","permalink":"false"},"description":"<img src=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/resource\/_5A075252-1581-4C1F-BF53-61269BC88346.jpg\" alt=\"5A075252-1581-4C1F-BF53-61269BC88346.jpg\" border=\"0\" style=\"float:left;margin:10px;\" width=\"77\" height=\"77\"\/>I'm excited to be able to go to SXSW this year (I'm giving a <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/entry\/my_ipod_thinks_i_m\">talk on music recommendation<\/a>). I'm especially looking forward to seeing and hearing some of the thousand-plus musicians and bands that will be playing this year at the festival. This week, the SXSW organizers posted the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/sxsw.com\/music\/shows\/bands\"> official list of 2009 artists<\/a> with 1200 or so bands with links to their home pages. Here's the head of the list:\n<p>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/sxsw.com\/music\/shows\/bands\"><img src=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/resource\/_sxsw-showcase.1.png\" alt=\"sxsw-showcase.1.png\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a> \n<p> I found the list incredibly daunting - I had not heard of most of the artists - how would I figure out which ones I wanted to see? I could imagine me sitting in a hotel room all week in Austin paralyzed by the many options.\n<p>\nI decided to deal with this problem directly - I just needed to add some context to this list - some photos, a little bio, some social tags, links to music and videos. If I had all that I could more easily pick the bands that I wanted to see. And so that's what I did. Using Last.fm's and Youtube's web services, I've created my own version of the SXSW Artist catalog that fills in all of the missing context. With the catalog, I can browse the artists alphabetically, by popularity and by tag. Here's an example:\n<p>\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/research.sun.com:8080\/SXSWArtistCatalog\/index.html\"><img src=\"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/resource\/_guide-pop.png\" alt=\"guide-pop.png\" border=\"0\"\/><\/a>\n<p>\nNow, with the catalog, I can, for instance, find all of the bands that have been tagged with \"<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/research.sun.com:8080\/SXSWArtistCatalog\/mathrock.html\">math rock<\/a>\" (there are currently 14 of them), audition them, look at their videos and decide which ones I want to see (<a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ecstaticsunshine.com\/\">Ecstatic Sunshine<\/a> looks interesting).\n<p> Building the catalog was fun. I decided to keep it as simple as possible, just a set of static HTML pages that get updated offline. No AJAX, no servlets, nothing but HTML. By keeping it simple, I was able to create the whole thing in a day. Getting all the data was pretty easy too. It is amazing what you can do with the web services at places like Last.fm and Youtube. It would have been impossible to build this sort of site 5 years ago. <p>I've put the catalog online - perhaps others will find it useful too.

Pretty easy right? Next, go to the Wikipedia and look at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_emo_artists\">List of Emo Artists<\/a> - they have a list of 75 or so bands that have 'been referred to as, or had their music described as emo'. Again, that seems to be pretty straightforward. But emo is not so simple. Just take a look at the <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Talk:List_of_emo_artists\">Wiki discussion page for the list of emo artists<\/a> - you'll find a debate as vigorous and vitriolic as the great emacs vs. vi debate of the 80s, the paper vs. plastic debate of the 90s and the Gervais vs. Carell debate of 00s all put together.\n<p> Some excerpts: <ul>\n<li> Emo is chaotic music. Emo is a form of hardcore punk. Emo is closely related to screamo. Pop rock is not. Who started this whole emo thing? Rites of Spring. Neon White, go listen to Rites of Spring. Tell me the difference between them and Panic! At the Disco. They just don't sound anything alike. I like all music, and pop rock, but I have enough sense to know that their is a huge line between emo, and mainstream music. Therefore, Wikipedia itself, is unreliable\n<li>hm.... im a bit puzzled here... the article is named \"list of emo band\", yet there's not a single emo band in the entire list....\n<li>My Chemical Romance is not emo. Alexisonfire is not emo, Fall Out Boy? just posers. Real emo music is emocore emo violence, screamo, emopunk, indie\/emorock\n<li>all Out Boy May not be emo but they are not possers\n<li>THREE DAYS GRACE not!!!! emo!!! they are POST GRUNGE!!!!\n<li> MCR IS NOT EMO\n<\/ul>\n<p>\nAnd the discussion just goes on and on. People can't agree what emo is.\n<p>\n<em>Photo (CC) by <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/flickr.com\/photos\/patetiiko\/\">Feel the Fever<\/a>.<\/em>","dc:creator":"plamere","y:title":"Music genre is hard","category":"General","title":"Music genre is hard","guid":{"isPermaLink":"true","content":"http:\/\/blogs.sun.com\/plamere\/entry\/music_genre_is_hard"},"pubDate":"Fri, 9 Jan 2009 14:03:33 -0800","y:published":{"hour":"22","timezone":"UTC","second":"33","month":"1","minute":"3","utime":"1231538613","day":"9","day_of_week":"5","year":"2009"}}]}})
