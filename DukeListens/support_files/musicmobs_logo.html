<h2>Musicmobs Joins The Last.fm Social Music Revolution</h2>
		    </p>
		    <h1>

Lots of links pointing this way mean I've resurected this to ensure your links don't get broken. Keep your links to musicmobs.com!

<p>This was a project by toby that is now part of the AMAZING last.fm project. Find the links to it and other great resources RIGHT HERE.
<P>Toby's personal statement...<p>
		    I started Musicmobs four years ago as personal project and an
exploration into social music. When we launched things looked quite
different than they do today. The phrase "Web 2.0" had never been
uttered, Audioscrobbler was the only social music tool, Friendster was
at the height of popularity and people were beginning to see the power
of user driven content and bottom up design.
</p>
Since then, I've devoted my life to developing Musicmobs and social
music discovery. You've seen a lot of this work on the site and with
Mobster. I've also spent a significant portion of my time developing
music industry relations and in two-way conversations about how people
will be listening to music in the future.
</p>
Over the last couple of years things have begun to change. Musicmobs
continued to grow to its current state thanks to all of our passionate
users and the excellent help from Maribel, Chris and Jeff, but I knew
this wasn't going to be enough. Many competitive services were
launching and our own costs were starting to grow beyond our ability
to support them.
</p>
I ended up spending less and less time developing the site and more
time looking into ways we could survive and grow into a service
everyone could use. This led to much soul searching about the
direction Musicmobs should take and where I wanted to be in the future.
</p>
I explored MANY options. Some were to go it alone as a startup, others
were to join a large company or larger startup and continue to
innovate with a greater pool of resources.
</p>
Late last year I started talking to Last.fm to see if the most obvious
fit was also the best. Those conversations ended up getting put on
hold as they went through their sale to CBS. Shortly following the
acquisition, Last.fm reached out to see if I was still interested in
the possibility of joining them.
</p>
A couple of flights to London later, it was pretty obvious that we
should be working together. Not only was their vision nearly identical
to my own, but we all got along extremely well and I was thrilled to
hear that they were big fans of Musicmobs!
</p>
Specifically, they really liked what we had done with Mobster. A lot
of what Musicmobs.com does is duplicated on Last.fm but Mobster
continues to be a unique application. This was very exciting to hear
since I always felt Mobster was one of the best parts of Musicmobs.
Unfortunately, it was a piece that was really hard to keep growing
since it required development on multiple evolving platforms.
</p>

In the end, I accepted Last.fm's offer to help create the social music
dream team :) I'll be heading up the desktop and client software
division and working with some really amazing people to take the
Last.fm desktop player to the next level.
</p>
Unfortunately, this does mean that Musicmobs will be coming down 
so I can focus on moving forward. Fortunately,
since my vision was so inline with Last.fm's, I will get to continue
to develop on the ideas that have grown over the last four years. In
many ways my work with Last.fm will be Musicmobs version 3.
</p>
I would like to thank all of the users that made Musicmobs what it is.
It's been an honor serving you to the best of my ability. I hope
you'll join me on Last.fm so we can continue to be on the cutting edge
of music!
