				<p>In the video <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/online/video/conference/2007/mccready">Music Intelligence: 2012</a>, Malcolm Gladwell (Tipping Point, Blink), interviews Mike McCready, CEO of Platinum Blue.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.platinumblueinc.com/">Platinum Blue</a>
 is a company that has a "hit predictor" as well as a hybrid music 
recommender (using social and 'mathematical similarity'). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I
 must admit that I've always been quite skeptical about hit predictors, 
and after watching this video I am even more skeptical.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Here's an example that set my bullsh*t detector off.</p><p>First we see a visualization of a music space:</p><p><img src="support_files/pb1.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Then,
 Mike shows us the same music space with all of the non-hits 
removed,&nbsp; this leaves a plot that shows just the hit songs:</p><p><img src="support_files/pb2.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">&nbsp;</p><p>It
 is rather amazing isn't it how well the hits cluster -&nbsp; and the 
clusters have such nice sharp boundaries too.&nbsp; It's almost too good
 to be true - no wait, it *is* too good to be true.<br><br>Platinum Blue
 claims that their hit predictor is 80% to 85% accurate.&nbsp; That's 
nothing, I can build a hit predictor that is 99.9% accurate.&nbsp; No 
matter what song you give my hit predictor it says "not a hit".&nbsp; If
 you run the 500,000 songs released last year through my hit predictor, 
it will only get about 500 of them wrong (the ones that actually became 
hits).<br></p><p>Listening to this interview makes my skin crawl - I 
just don't buy it, and I'm rather disappointed with Malcom Gladwell just
 accepting this without showing any skepticism.<br></p>

                Wow, my brain must be a computer, because when I heard 
Norah Jones' "Come Away With Me" I thought it would be a hit too.  Man 
oh man.  Discover a Gnarles Barkley or a Strokes or a Modest Mouse or an
 "Oh Brother Where Art Thou"...something unexpected and out of the 
ordinary.<br>  
<br>
Being proud of your software for predicting that Norah Jones album would
 be a hit is like being proud of looking out the window on a hot sunny 
day and predicting that the pool will be busy.<br>
<br>
Any of these companies (another one is <a href="http://www.musintelligence.com/" rel="nofollow">Music Intelligence Solutions</a>)
 who claim to have come up with a system to mathematically generate hits
 has never been to a sweaty bar at 1:30 in the morning covered in 
somebody else's cigarette smoke just basking in the raw power of the 
music that is pouring out of the speakers.<br>
<br>
Bleh.

                Everybody here needs a ROC analysis class and the folks at platinum blue as well...

                Maybe, by 85% accuracy, he meant 85% mean average 
precision.  Or precision at 100% recall.  The latter makes more sense, 
actually.  Suppose, out of 100,000 songs, there are 100 hits.  By the 
time you've extracted 100th hit, how many non-hits have you also 
extracted?  If the answer is somewhere around 18, then you have 85% 
accuracy.  Natch?

I think you're thinking of this too much as a classification problem, 
where you're interpreting "accuracy" as a correct label (hit vs. 
non-hit).  If, on the other hand, you take the information retrieval 
perspective, and think of it as the problem of selecting a set of hits 
from a large collection of non-hits, then all that counts in that score 
is total-relevant divided by total-retrieved.  Or, 
total-true-hits-extracted divided by total-extracted.

D'ya see what I mean?

                Yeah, I see what you mean.  I understand too that when 
giving a talk to the general public it is best not to talk about ROC, F 
measures and all that, since 85% of the people won't know what you mean.
  My point is that saying you have an 85% accuracy is meaningless for a 
hit predictor.  
<p>
Looking at the Platinum blue FAQ we see this question and answer:
</p><p>
<b>Q: What is the accuracy of Music Xray™?</b>
</p><p>
A: Most singles released by music labels sound and feel like hits but 
lack the optimal mathematical patterns. This is a main reason why the 
industry has less than a 20% success rate. Less than one in 5 songs that
 are released as singles and promoted iwth(sic) a significant budget 
actually reach the charts. By using Platinum Blue’s technology, hit 
rates can be increased to over 80% - four times the current industry 
rate - effectively providing a risk management capability that helps 
yeild(sic) significant improvement in return on investment.
</p><p>
But this doesn't tell us much either.  The only thing I learn is that my song may <i>lack the optimal mathematical patterns</i>.

                the poor a+r managers -do they still exist? - have been 
so scared in the past that some of them bought this polyphonic hmi 
stuff, ... and they had never heard anything about ROC ...
