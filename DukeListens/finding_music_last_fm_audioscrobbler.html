</p><p>
Let's continue our look at music recommendation services ... </p><p>
<a href="https://last.fm/">last.fm</a> is a personalized streaming radio 
and music recommendation system.  Last.fm builds up a listening profile 
for each user and based upon their listening habits can make 
recommendations and generate a 'radio' station (streaming audio) 
customized to the tastes of each listener.  What makes last.fm unique 
among all of the music recommenders out there is that it uses an 
audioplayer plug-in to track what the user is playing, instead of 
relying on user ratings or uploaded playlists.  When you enroll in 
last.fm, you can download and install the audioscrobbler plugin. 
Whenever you play a song, the plugin 'phones-home' with the details 
about what song you played, when you played it, and who you are.  This 
means that last.fm can track not just what songs you have, or what 
artists you collect, but what music you are actually listening to.  I 
think this is  an extremely important advantage that last.fm has over 
other recommenders.  Most people have songs in their music collection 
that they never listen to (for instance, my 10-year-old daughter's 
DisneyMania CDs are part of my music collection), a recommender that 
bases recommendations on what is in your collection is going to use 
those songs that you never listen to and give you bad recommendations. 
With the last.fm model, only the songs that you listen to factor into 
the recommendations.  The more you play a song, the more weight that 
song is given. It is like having an automatic rating system for your 
music.
</p><p> 
There are some other advantages to the last.fm model.  Since it relies 
on an instrumented player to automatically send info back to the server,
 last.fm has been able to amass a very large database of    music 
profiles.  For any kind of recommendation system, the more data the 
better.  Last.fm gives very good music recommendations (the best I've 
seen) with very good coverage (it is extremely rare to encounter a band 
that last.fm doesn't know about). Just to give you an idea of their 
coverage, here are some stats.  In the last.fm database:
</p><ul>
<li>1,240,919 people have listened to the Beatles
</li><li> 698,795 people have listened to Weezer
</li><li> 18,324 people have listened to Dave Brubeck
</li></ul>

One really cool thing about last.fm is that since they are watching what
 thousands of people are playing, they have extremely accurate and up to
 date  <a href="https://www.last.fm/charts/">music charts</a>.  One can watch a new song or CD rapidly climb the charts. No need to wait a week for the new Billboard to arrive.
<p>
There are some downsides to the last.fm model. For one thing, having to 
download and install a music player plugin is a technical barrier to a 
very large class of listeners.  The non-technical users are definitely 
under-representated in the last.fm database.  Looking at the <a href="https://www.last.fm/charts/">top artist charts</a>
 we find bands like Coldplay, Radiohead, Weezer and the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers, definitely a geek bias here, (not that that is necessarily a 
bad thing though...).  And of course there's the whole privacy issue. 
Some folks just don't like the idea that their music player is sending 
information about their music listening habits to some remote server.
</p><p>
Last.fm seems to be doing a lot of things the right way.  They are 
friendly to developers, they publish their plugin protocol, they expose 
their derived data via a <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/">web services</a> interface.  They even release dumps of their database under a creative commons license for use by researchers.  
</p><p>
It will be interesting to see if last.fm can compete even as the 
mega-music sites like Yahoo and iTunes move into this space.  I think 
they have a lot to offer.

                there is also the stunning <a href="http://www.musicplasma.com/" rel="nofollow">musicplasma.com</a>
 which I had the intention on writing about ages ago, but I'll let you 
have a go (and then just post a small blog entry to point back to here 
once your'e done Duke).

Inaccurate in places, but I do like the interactivity of it and the way 
it re-alligns the "planets" when you jump from a to b, ie type in 
Kraftwerk, hit on Brian Eno to get to Biosphere and then  watch the 
circles resize, move around or just disappear.

Quite presize on Townes Van Zandt as I see it - Gillian Welch, Lyle 
Lovett, Emmylou Harris and Johnny Cash generating some large circles.
