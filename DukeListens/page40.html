<b>#5 - Amazon didn't launch a music store. &nbsp; - </b>Early in 2006 the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://users1.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB114005222162375368.html">reported</a>
 that Amazon was getting ready to open a digital music store to compete 
with the almighty iTunes.&nbsp; According to the WSJ, Amazon would offer
 an all-you-can-eat subscription service and a branded Amazon player 
from Samsung, with a scheduled store launch in the summer of 2006.&nbsp;
  Well, Summer came and went - with no sign of the music store. Jeff 
Bezos - head of the Amazon empire was heard remarking that Amazon would 
not get into the music business until they could figure out what they 
could do that would be different than all of the other offerings out 
there.&nbsp; Now <a href="http://hypebot.typepad.com/hypebot/2006/12/amazon_to_enter.html">rumors</a>
 are that Amazon is planning on launching the store as early as March 
2007.&nbsp; I'm excited about this - really excited. Here's why:</p><ul><li><b>MP3s -&nbsp; </b>Rumor
 is that the Amazon store will sell music that is not DRM laden -meaning
 that the songs will play in any device without restriction.&nbsp; The 
Amazon store may be the first big step toward the<a href="http://digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com/2007/01/06/cringely-says-drm-doomed-in-2007-so-is-zune/"> death of DRM</a>. This is also good news for anyone trying to do content-based recommendation - systems like those used by <a href="http://www.musicip.com/">MusicIP</a>
 that analyze the content of the music don't work when the music is 
protected by DRM.&nbsp; Likewise researchers in the Music Information 
Retrieval community working on problems such as automatic music 
classification, beat detection,&nbsp; thumbnailing, summarization, etc. 
will be able to work with Amazon supplied MP3s - something that they 
can't do with the billions of tracks that have been purchased from 
iTunes.</li><li><b>Subscription model -&nbsp; </b>It is hard to square 
an all-you-can-eat subscription model with DRM-free MP3s -&nbsp; so I am
 a bit skeptical that Amazon would offer this - but still, it is 
interesting to think about an Amazon-branded music player coupled with 
such a music subscription service.&nbsp; The mobile phone model would 
seem to work well here - Amazon could offer a free Amazon music player 
with a 2-year music subscription.&nbsp; The music player could be one of
 the nano-esque Samsung players that look very nice.<br></li></ul><blockquote><blockquote><img src="support_files/sams_k3.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br></blockquote></blockquote><ul><li><b>Discovery -&nbsp; </b>Amazon's
 focus on discovery makes Amazon a much better online bookstore than any
 other bookstore.&nbsp; They use all sorts of ways to connect a reader 
with a book.&nbsp; Collaborative filtering, book reviews, customer 
lists,&nbsp; content search,&nbsp; best seller lists , special 
deals.&nbsp; These techniques help get their readers deep into the long 
tail of books.&nbsp; Discovery is in Amazon's genes.&nbsp; When they 
start selling digital music, you can bet that they will have the same 
focus on discovery and give the listener new and interesting ways to 
find music in the long tail.&nbsp; A listener may come to Amazon to pick
 up the latest U2 track, but may find themselves happily downloading a 
track by an obscure artist.&nbsp; This is good for the listener - they 
will will be exposed to a larger variety of music and this is good for 
the long tail artists.</li><li><b>Metadata - </b>Amazon has a great set 
of web services built around their data.&nbsp; Using Amazon's web 
services, one can get access to book descriptions, book cover images, 
reviews, pricing information - just about&nbsp; any piece of data&nbsp; 
in Amazon's database is exposed via their web services.&nbsp; Exposing 
their data in this fashion places Amazon at the center of the online 
literary ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any startup company that wants to be in a
 business related to books will&nbsp; use Amazon's API&nbsp; because it 
is easy, the data is of high quality and it is free.&nbsp; This is good 
for the startup, and even better for Amazon since all of those startups 
end up sending their customers to Amazon.&nbsp; Amazon is already a big 
part of the music ecosystem.&nbsp; They already have lots of data for 
music CDs that is available via their web APIs.&nbsp; They are probably 
the largest supplier of album art on the web.&nbsp; The Amazon part 
number - the ASIN - is used throughout the web as an unambiguous 
identifier for an album. Once Amazon starts to sell individual tracks, I
 would expect that Amazon will create an ASIN or an equivalent for each 
track in their database.&nbsp; This track-level identifier may become 
the primary way of identifying tracks in the music world since Amazon 
makes it so easy to get all of the information about an item once you 
have the ASIN.&nbsp; This could be a key enabler in the next generation 
of music - a&nbsp; ubiquitous song ID tied to deep metadata.</li><li><b>Variable pricing - </b>Instead
 of $0.99 per track Amazon will set the price of a song related to its 
popularity and freshness.&nbsp; There's no reason that a track that 
sells only a few copies a year should sell for the same price as the 
latest chart topper.&nbsp; Sites like <a href="http://amiestreet.com/welcome">Amie Street</a>
 are already demonstrating that variable pricing models can be a really 
interesting part of the discovery process and an important business 
model.<br></li><li><b>Brand -&nbsp; </b>The Amazon brand is well known 
and liked (at least in the U.S) - this gives them a big step up over 
companies like Microsoft (that has a less than stellar reputation in 
some <a href="https://slashdot.org/">circles)</a> and eMusic (which is not well known outside of the music geek world).&nbsp; <br></li></ul><p>So
 Amazon has a lot going for it.&nbsp; Now let me offer a few suggestions
 to the folks building the Amazon music store that will make a big 
difference to the digital music world:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<b>ASIN &lt;--&gt; MBID</b> - provide a web service that will map between ASINs and MusicBrainz IDs.&nbsp; <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>
 is a community music metadatabase that provides all sorts of 
interesting music metadata for artists, albums and songs.&nbsp; An MBID 
is the MusicBrainz ID that is associated with a track, album or 
artist.&nbsp; If there's an easy bridge between the Amazon metadata and 
the MusicBrainz data, the value of both databases will be enhanced.</li><li><b>Use XSPF </b>- <a href="http://xspf.org/">XSPF</a>
 is an emerging xml-based playlist format that is designed to encourage 
playlist sharing and portability.&nbsp; XSPF is simple, portable and 
open. By adopting the XSPF format Amazon would&nbsp; increase the 
visibility and use of this format leading to its wide adoption as <i>the</i> way of representing playlists.</li><li><b>Don't DRM the 30 second clips - </b>There
 are lots of&nbsp; people in the research and in the commercial world 
that are doing interesting things with audio - things like content-based
 recommendation, mood classification, beat tracking, music 
visualization.&nbsp; A common problem for these folks is getting access 
to the audio - especially for new music. It is expensive to build a 
research collection around new music - and after a couple of years the 
research collection is no longer new.&nbsp; If Amazon provided a way to 
turn an ASIN into a 30 second snippet of a song (even a low quality 
excerpt), they would enable a whole new generation of content-based 
music research - that would ultimately lead to a much more interesting 
set of tools for exploring and interacting with music.</li></ul>So .. 
yes, I'm bullish on Amazon in the music space.&nbsp; Amazon's emphasis 
on discovery, their willingness to provide access to their metadata and 
their rejection of DRM give them the ability to compete with the 
all-mighty iTunes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course a year from now, I may be
 writing once again about Amazon in the "Top things that didn't happen 
in 2007" blog entry - but I think that&nbsp; in 2007 we may see the 
tipping point for digital music and Amazon may be at the center of it 
all.<br><p><br><br></p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>#4 - Google didn't think music was worth indexing&nbsp; </b>- Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/corporate/">mission</a>
 is to "organize the world's information and make it universally 
accessible and useful."&nbsp; To this end, Google has been innovating in
 text search, mapping software,&nbsp; and image search.&nbsp; Google is 
now working with libraries to digitally scan books from their 
collections and will start to add this data to its main search index. 
This book scanning effort has been&nbsp; controversial since Google is 
scanning books with out the approval of the publishers.&nbsp; But Google
 doesn't mind a fight - and is not shy about dealing with copyright 
holders.&nbsp; So with Google's mission to organize the world's 
information along with its willingness to go toe-to-toe with copyright 
holders one would think that Google would be building an index of music 
and music metadata and applying some of those nifty approaches used in 
the <a href="http://www.ismir.net/">MIR community</a> to allow people to
 find music and information about music.&nbsp; But instead of an all 
encompassing music index, Google has just stuck its toe in the music 
search water.&nbsp; It has released only a few music related search 
features. First there is&nbsp; <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/music">Music Trends</a> from Google labs - this is Google's version of <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/">Audioscrobbler</a>
 - think of last.fm without all of the users or nifty features like song
 tagging, friends,&nbsp; tag radio, or&nbsp; recommendations. Then 
there's <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/searching-for-music.html">Google Music search</a>&nbsp;
 which adds all sorts of information about an artist search result such 
as cover art, photos, reviews, links to buy the cd - pretty neat stuff, 
but a far cry from a real music search such as we see with <a href="http://mp3realm.org/">Mp3Realm</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.melodyhound.com/"> Melody Hound </a>or <a href="http://search.mercora.com/v6/search.jsp">Mercora.</a></p><p><a href="http://search.mercora.com/v6/search.jsp"></a>The
 question is 'Why hasn't Google done for music what it is doing for 
Books?'&nbsp; Why does Google seem to be ignoring its mission to 
organize the world's information when it comes to music?&nbsp; Is it 
because the music industry has more collective power than the book 
publishing industry?&nbsp; Is it because <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001553.php">Sergey doesn't listen to much music</a>?&nbsp; Or perhaps Google is already building the ultimate music search index and will unleash it on the world in 2007.<br>

				<p><b>#3 Yahoo didn't buy last.fm </b>- for a while it seemed that 
Yahoo was going to buy all of the Web 2.0 companies. They bought Flickr.
 They bought Deli.cio.us.&nbsp; It seemed quite natural that the next 
thing they would buy would be venerable (in the web sense) 
Last.FM.&nbsp; Last.FM is one of the first of the Music 2.0 companies - 
they have been collecting all sorts of really interesting data - social 
tags,&nbsp; user song plays.&nbsp; Over the last 4 years they've 
collected billions of data points about music taste.&nbsp; This data can
 be used for all sorts of things: recommendations, identifying 
tastemakers , novel playlist generation, spotting the next breakout 
band.&nbsp;&nbsp; So with Yahoo seemingly buying every Web 2.0 company 
it could, it seemed only natural that Last.FM would join the Yahoo 
empire.&nbsp; But instead, there was the <a href="https://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116379821933826657-0mbjXoHnQwDMFH_PVeb_jqe3Chk_20061125.html">Peanut butter manifesto</a>
 about Yahoo spreading itself too thin.&nbsp; Yahoo was having a hard 
time figuring out how to monetize its Flickr and Del.icio.us 
acquisitions. The social music space was getting crowded with newcomers 
launching every other month.&nbsp; At the end of the year, Last.fm was 
still an independent company - it still was the largest social music 
network with <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2006/11/pandora_vs_last.html">5 million unique visitors per month</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Now&nbsp; the maturing last.fm has to figure out how to use those 
eyeballs and all that golden data into to stay ahead of the pack - 
without the help of a company like Yahoo.<br></p>

				<p><b>#2 - Microsoft didn't try</b>
- With Apple merely treading water in 2006 it seemed that there might be
 room for a challenger. The obvious candidate was Microsoft's 
Zune.&nbsp; On paper the Zune looked like it could be a serious 
contender. It had some novel features like wifi and song sharing. It had
 a nice display and cool interface.&nbsp; But the Zune had a few 
problems at launch.&nbsp; The gadget bloggers had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006/11/13/installing-the-zune-sucked/">horrible install problems</a> with the first Zunes.&nbsp; There were some rather strange <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/-flx-/294929001/in/set-72157594292367584">images</a> and <a href="http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/microsoft-releases-monster-zune-ad">advertisements.</a>
 The device itself looked and felt like a brick compared to the 
iPod.&nbsp; The device didn't support podcasts.&nbsp; It didn't work 
with Vista.&nbsp; You had to use confusing Zune Points to buy songs. And
 on and on. Now these glitches could have been forgiven - Microsoft is 
known for under-delivering on version 1.0 products - if the core 
experience was novel and interesting.&nbsp; But the key distinguishing 
feature of the Zune - the song sharing (aka 'squirting') was hamstrung -
 by overbearing DRM - the shared songs would dissolve after 3 plays or 3
 days.&nbsp; The Zune wifi couldn't be used for syncing or listening to 
streaming internet radio.&nbsp; Microsoft turned its back on its 
PlayForSure licensees by creating a new and incompatible DRM - (the only
 reason was to create their own iTunes-like proprietary music silo) and 
perhaps worst of all Microsoft bought into the fiction put forward by 
the music labels that anyone with a digital music player must be a 
thief. Microsoft agreed to pay a<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/09/on-universal-music-groups-zune-tax/"> music tax to Universa</a>l
 for every Zune sold.&nbsp; It was almost as if Microsoft wasn't even 
trying with the Zune.&nbsp; Bill Gates even said admitted that Microsoft
 had only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006/11/18/gates-praises-ipod-labels-zune-a-modest-competitor/">'modest'</a>
 aspirations with the Zune.&nbsp; Despite my misgivings about Microsoft 
in general, I was really hoping that they would do something interesting
 with the Zune - at least that would stimulate some innovation in the 
digital music world.&nbsp; But I fear Michael Robertson's <a href="http://www.michaelrobertson.com/archive.php?minute_id=219">prediction about the Zune</a> will be right on the mark.&nbsp; <br>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>
I really thought that 2006 would be a year of momentous events in the
digital music world - instead 2006 will likely be remembered as the
year that nothing happened.  Since this is the season for making lists, here's my contribution 

(Now since I am a lazy blogger, I'm going to break this list up into 5 separate posts, sorry):

</p><h3 align="center"><b>The top 5 things in the digital music world that didn't happen in 2006</b> <br></h3><p><b>#1 - Apple didn't innovate</b>
 - Apple, the undisputed leader in the digital
music world, with its stunnning 85% market share, with more than a
billion tracks sold, and the sole supplier of the coveted 'perfect 
thing'&nbsp; is
spending less time on music and more time on video -&nbsp; expanding its
 iTunes empire to include TV and movies.  This focus on video leaves
few cycles left in Cupertino to devote to improving the music 
experience.
This year Apple gave us music listeners a few crumbs: gapless playback, a
 slightly smarter shuffle,
an album art browser and a minimal text search capability on its
latest iPod.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are lots of things that Apple could have 
done but didn't.&nbsp;
Apple didn't offer an 'all-you-can-eat'&nbsp; music subscription 
service. Apple didn't
add music or taste sharing to iTunes or the iPod. Apple didn't improve 
iTunes music discovery tools&nbsp; to help
get listeners beyond the short head - much less into the long tail. 
Apple didn't do much to help us find music on our own iPods - an iPod 
becomes the place where a song goes to die - 60% of songs on a typical 
iPod have never been listened to by its owner. One would think that this
 inattention to the music space would leave Apple
a little vulnerable - perhaps that's what Microsoft thought - perhaps 
that's
why Microsoft barely tried with the Zune.

				<p><a title="Frederick Gisson" href="http://fgiasson.com/">Frédérick Giasson</a> has published a first version of the <a href="http://pingthesemanticweb.com/ontology/mo/">Music Ontology Specification</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The goal of this ontology specification is to provide main concepts and
 properties for music on the Semantic Web.&nbsp; The Music Ontology is 
expressed as an RDF/XML specification.&nbsp;</p><p>The current 
specification lists 19 classes such as Album, Artist, EP, Soundtrack, 
Track, Type and 50+ properties that apply to these classes.&nbsp; The 
classes and properties are based solely on the class, types and 
relationships defined by the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> project.</p><p>Frederick has set up <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/music-ontology-specification-group">a Google mailing list</a> for folks to provide comments and suggestions for the ontology.<br>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>The masters of the smooth song at transition at <a href="http://echonest.com/">The Echo Nest</a>&nbsp; have put together a <a href="http://echonest.com/lab/cast/article/11/jingle-bells">10 minute version of the Christmas classic</a>
 by stitching together&nbsp; of 50 different versions of Jingle 
Bells.&nbsp; Some of the transitions in the clip are really quite 
amazing - better than a human could do - of course the computer has the 
advantage - not only can it align the songs and manipulate the faders 
like a human can do - it can also time stretch or compress a song to 
force it to align - something that even the best turntable master would 
have a hard time doing.&nbsp; Some of the song alignment 
techiniques&nbsp; are described in<a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Etristan/phd/dissertation/chapter6.html"> chapter six of Tristan's thesis</a>.</p><p>I
 hope that Echo Nest opens up for business soon - the song transition 
technology that they are pioneering will be an important distinguishing 
feature for them.&nbsp; I've listened to many hours of automatic radio -
 shuffle play on the iPod, as well as the streaming recommender radio 
stations like Pandora or last.fm - and have grown weary of the 'iPod 
whiplash' that comes from these systems.</p><p><br>

				<p><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/19/scoop-ticketmaster-poors-133-million-into-ilike/">Techcrunch</a> is reporting that Ticketmaster is pouring over 13 million dollars into <a href="http://www.ilike.com/">iLike</a>
 for a 25% stake in the music discovery venture. That puts the value of 
iLike at 52 million dollars which is not bad considering that the iLike 
site has only been live for a few months.&nbsp; I have no idea how many 
users iLike has, but I don't think they've acquired a huge number in the
 last couple of months.&nbsp; Right now iLike is telling me that there 
are about 250 iLike users that are online or 'listening now!'.&nbsp; If 
that is one percent of the total active listeners that gives iLike 
25,000 active users. If we use&nbsp;<a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/12/01/8364594/index.htm"> $38 per pair of eyeballs</a>
 as a metric for what a site is worth -&nbsp; the 13 million dollar 
investment means that Ticketmaster thinks that iLike will be growing 
that set of 25K users to 1.4 million users in the near future.&nbsp; 
Maybe so - but if so, it can't be because of iLike's recommendations - I
 continue to be underwhelmed by them - they are continuing to recommend 
'the chipmunk song' - they don't tell me why they recommend it - but it 
has been there since day one. Today's new recommendation is 'in the name
 of love' by U2 - not exactly a fresh new track to add to my 
collection.&nbsp; iLike's strengths are their deep pockets (which just 
got deeper) that lets them launch an effective marketing campaign,&nbsp;
 a sticky iTunes plugin that keeps users 'visiting' the iLike site every
 time they use iTunes, and their extensive Silicon Valley connections 
that give them good press in sites like TechCrunch.

				Rumors are circulating once again of the impending opening of the 
Amazon MP3 Store. This time, the rumors are even more interesting.&nbsp;
 The <a href="http://hypebot.typepad.com/hypebot/">Hypebot</a> says that
 the Amazon store will only sell non-DRM-laden MP3s and will sell them 
at a variable price.&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to seeing what 
Amazon will do in this space.&nbsp; They are known for their 
recommendations, customer reviews&nbsp; and all sorts of other nifty 
things in order to help hook their customers up with their 
content.&nbsp; If Amazon opens an MP3-only store and they offer a strong
 catalog they could give iTunes a run for their money. (via the <a href="http://digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com/">digital music weblog</a>).

				One of the most frequently used music samples of all time is the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen_break">amen break'</a> - a 5 second snippet of a drum break performed by <a title="Gregory Cylvester Coleman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Cylvester_Coleman">Gregory Cylvester Coleman</a>&nbsp; in 1969. &nbsp; The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen_break">wikipedia entry</a>
 has an excellent history of the amen break and use - but to really get a
 feel for the amen break it is best to listen to how it is used.&nbsp; 
Last.fm tag radio helps here.&nbsp; There are<a href="https://www.last.fm/tag/amen%20break"> 23 songs tagged </a>with 'amen break' - last.fm users&nbsp; can listen to them here: <a href="lastfm://globaltags/Amen%20break">lastfm://globaltags/Amen%20break</a>
