				<p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>#4 - Google didn't think music was worth indexing&nbsp; </b>- Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/corporate/">mission</a>
 is to "organize the world's information and make it universally 
accessible and useful."&nbsp; To this end, Google has been innovating in
 text search, mapping software,&nbsp; and image search.&nbsp; Google is 
now working with libraries to digitally scan books from their 
collections and will start to add this data to its main search index. 
This book scanning effort has been&nbsp; controversial since Google is 
scanning books with out the approval of the publishers.&nbsp; But Google
 doesn't mind a fight - and is not shy about dealing with copyright 
holders.&nbsp; So with Google's mission to organize the world's 
information along with its willingness to go toe-to-toe with copyright 
holders one would think that Google would be building an index of music 
and music metadata and applying some of those nifty approaches used in 
the <a href="http://www.ismir.net/">MIR community</a> to allow people to
 find music and information about music.&nbsp; But instead of an all 
encompassing music index, Google has just stuck its toe in the music 
search water.&nbsp; It has released only a few music related search 
features. First there is&nbsp; <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/music">Music Trends</a> from Google labs - this is Google's version of <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/">Audioscrobbler</a>
 - think of last.fm without all of the users or nifty features like song
 tagging, friends,&nbsp; tag radio, or&nbsp; recommendations. Then 
there's <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/searching-for-music.html">Google Music search</a>&nbsp;
 which adds all sorts of information about an artist search result such 
as cover art, photos, reviews, links to buy the cd - pretty neat stuff, 
but a far cry from a real music search such as we see with <a href="http://mp3realm.org/">Mp3Realm</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.melodyhound.com/"> Melody Hound </a>or <a href="http://search.mercora.com/v6/search.jsp">Mercora.</a></p><p><a href="http://search.mercora.com/v6/search.jsp"></a>The
 question is 'Why hasn't Google done for music what it is doing for 
Books?'&nbsp; Why does Google seem to be ignoring its mission to 
organize the world's information when it comes to music?&nbsp; Is it 
because the music industry has more collective power than the book 
publishing industry?&nbsp; Is it because <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001553.php">Sergey doesn't listen to much music</a>?&nbsp; Or perhaps Google is already building the ultimate music search index and will unleash it on the world in 2007.<br>

                <p>
I've asked Google about indexing music many times over the years.. in 
2001, 2002, 2004 and 2005.  I've spoken with some fairly senior people: 
One of them wrote the AI textbook you probably used as an undergrad; one
 of them studied under information retrieval grandfather Gerard Salton. 
 One of them was on the organizing committee for the original ISMIR (in 
2000), but never showed up to the conference (I think he had just 
accepted a position at Google).  
</p><p>
The first three times I spoke to them (2001-2004), Google's response 
was: "We are not doing music; we are afraid of copyright holders".  I 
patiently explained to them that you do not need to fear copyright 
holders if you are searching your own collection, coming up with 
intelligent playlists for the thousands of songs you already own.  You 
do not need to fear copyright holders if you are the intelligent search 
interface to Apple iTunes, the way you are to AOL.  The rights are all 
taken care of, in those cases.  But they reiterated their stance each 
time: No go.  The last time (in 2005), they didn't say anything about 
copyright.  They just said "We're not doing music."  Period.  
</p><p>
So from my own perspective, it seems like Google is not just ignoring 
its mission to organize the world's information when it comes to music. 
 It seems like Google is actively trying <i>not</i> to do music.  I haven't the faintest clue why.
</p><p>
But all the arguments you make about Google's willingness to go 
toe-to-toe with copyright holders is spot on.  In fact, I think they 
probably have a better legally-defensible position in creating search 
technology that allows users to organize their own music collections 
(think: Google Desktop for your iPod) than they do in going in to 
libraries and making full, high-quality scans of books that they do not 
own.  
</p><p>
And yet they do the latter, and not the former.  I wish someone from Google would explain this to the rest of us.

                Sure, asking Adam B is the thing to do ...but we've 
never been introduced - and I don't think he'd tell me anyway. By the 
way, I think Adam is the guy behind the current Google Music Search:

                ok, I talked to Adam years ago, i guess ISMIR03, we had 
few emails, he is really a smart guy ... and by rumours somebody told me
 somewhen in 2005 or so that he has moved to Google, but so far I never 
asked, lets see, I will give it a try!
