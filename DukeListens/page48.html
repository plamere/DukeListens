		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				I always enjoy the poster sessions, its a great chance to talk with a
 researcher about their work, see their demos, discuss their results. <br><br>The
 difficulty with poster sessions at ISMIR, is that many times, a poster 
includes a demo of some sort that includes music, and it is just too 
noisy in the poster area to hear any kind of music.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, 
this year, the food tables were positioned a bit too close to the 
posters, making it tough to get to some posters (I noticed in the second
 poster session they had repositioned things to make a little more 
room).<br><br>There were nearly 20 posters shown on Monday. I wish I had
 time to write about all of the interesting ones, but let me highlight a
 few. <br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/plamere/265773172/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="support_files/265773172_eeddb72ded_m.jpg" alt="Oscar's poster" height="180" width="240"></a><br></div><br>The
 folks from UPF were showing a demo of 'Good Vibrations', a tool for 
music tagging, exploration and discovery.&nbsp; This system allows users
 to tag songs with their own 'concepts'&nbsp; The system learns how 
these relate these concepts to the audio content.<br><br><div style="text-align: left;">Right next to the UPF poster was MirRocket.<br><div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/plamere/265773165/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="support_files/265773165_c72e6fe279_m.jpg" alt="MirRocket Poster" height="180" width="240"></a><br></div></div>This
 is a WinAmp plugin that collects music features and sends them back to a
 server where they are collected and will eventually be made available 
for researchers.&nbsp; You can sign up to be a beta tester for MirRocket
 at <a href="http://www.intelligentsound.org/home.php" target="_self">IntelligentSound</a>.<br><br><div>Particularly impressive is the <a href="http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/" target="_self">Sonic Visualiser</a>
 being offered by researchers at Queen Mary's. The Sonic Visualizer is a
 system that assists in the visualization of audio data (and music in 
particular). The Sonic visualizer is released as open source and 
distributed under a the GPL, and is available for Linux, Mac OS X and 
Windows.<br><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="support_files/sv2-thumb.png"></div></div><br><br><div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="text-align: left;">Rebecca Fiebrink's poster on Feature Selection Pitfalls and Music Classification was particularly popular.&nbsp; <br> <div style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/plamere/265773162/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/page48_files/265773162_99bec416b9_m.jpg" alt="Rebecca's VPP (very popular poster)" height="240" width="180"></a><br></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br>I was never able to get close enough to hear her pitch, there always seemed to be a group at the poster.<br></div><br><div style="text-align: left;">And
 how can I fail to mention the 'Map of Mozart'&nbsp; - where researchers
 at Vienna create a self-organizing-map of the music of Mozart into the 
shape of Mozart himself!&nbsp; Read more about this at "<a href="http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/mozart/index_en.html" target="_self">The Map of Mozart"</a><br></div></div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img src="support_files/screen_sdhmoz_cut_s.png"><br><br><br><div style="text-align: left;">Yes,
 there were many more posters, and I wish I had time to write about them
 all, but now it is time to go find some breakfast and get ready for 
ISMIR day 2!<br></div></div></div>

 of the best moments at ISMIR for me is when I get the brand new, 
printed copy of the proceedings.&nbsp; The proceedings offer many months
 of in-depth reading on MIR topics (I still have not got through all of 
the papers in ISMIR 2005 proceedings).&nbsp; This year's proceedings are
 noticably thinner than last year's.&nbsp; I talked briefly with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Erbd/" target="_self">Roger Dannenberg</a>,
 one of the editors of the proceedings.&nbsp; He explained that last 
year there were so many papers that they had to split the conference 
into multiple tracks, meaning that it was impossible to hear every talk 
at the conference. This year they wanted a single track, which led to a 
much shorter schedule,&nbsp; fewer accepted papers and a short 
proceedings.&nbsp; Nevertheless, thanks to Roger and his co-editors 
Kjell Lemstrom and Adam Tindale for putting this together.<br><br>The 
"Duke Listen's" Best Paper Title&nbsp; award this year goes to Megan 
Winget for her paper entitled "Heroic Frogs Save the Bow: Performing 
Musician's annotation and interaction behavior with written music'<br><br>

 am hoping that I'll be able to blog during the conference, but usually

I'm getting ready to drive up to Montreal for a day at the <a href="http://www.futureofmusic.org/" target="_self">Future of Music Summit</a>.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></span>It
 will be a great day hobnobbing with the players in the music business, 
listening to talks and panel sessions, and thinking about what are the 
next critical steps in getting to the celestial jukebox. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>One
 critical step on the journey to the celestial jukebox is the 
availability of high quality music metadata - all the data that 
surrounds the music - the artist information, the album information, 
album art, descriptions, bios, reviews - its all an important part of 
the music experience.&nbsp; One of the best provider of this data is <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/" target="_self">MusicBrainz.</a>&nbsp;
 MusicBrainz uses the opensource model for building up their music 
metadatabase.&nbsp; Users contribute, moderate and review data.&nbsp; 
The data is available via a web services API or you can just download 
the data and host your own database.&nbsp; Most of the data is either 
given to the public domain (no rights reserved) or under a creative 
commons license.&nbsp; It's really good data, and the MusicBrainz folks 
have done a good job of&nbsp; organizing it and making it widely 
available.&nbsp; That's why I was really glad to see <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/10/musicip_continu.html" target="_self">this post</a> by Mayhem&nbsp; (aka Robert Kaye), the founder of MusicBrainz indicating that due to a generous donation by Matt Dunn of <a href="http://musicip.com/" target="_self">MusicIP,</a> that he'd be able to attend the FOM summit.&nbsp; Way to go Matt!&nbsp;&nbsp;

 which is a 'personal DJ that automatically selects and plays songs from
 your library based on your personal tastes and the music that your 
listening to.<br><br><img src="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/support_files/sfdjplayer.png"><br><br>Soundflavor
 uses a combination of collaborative filtering, lyrics and music content
 to find music similarity.&nbsp; I don't believe that they do any kind 
of automatic analysis of the content, instead they perform a 
light-weight labelling of the music (like what mood logic used to 
do).&nbsp; <br><br>The SoundFlavor folks put a lot of effort into the 
design of this app. They've been working with Adaptive Path, the user 
experience experts, to make a program that is simple to use.<br><br>The 
system looks nice based on the screenshots, but since it is a 
Windows-only version, I have no means to try it out to see how well it 
works.&nbsp; I await the mac version.<br><br>

<div style="margin-left: 10px; float: right;"> <img src="support_files/241560709_3c7133ba2b_m.jpg"></div>As the the long tail gets longer, filters and recommenders grow in their importance as <span style="font-weight: bold;">the</span>
 way people will find music.&nbsp; Clearly, the most popular type of 
recommender right now is the social recommender. We see social 
recommenders all over the web. Sites like Amazon, Last.fm,&nbsp; Digg, 
Yahoo Music all use social recommenders.<br><br>Social recommenders, 
however, are extremely vulnerable to&nbsp; certain kinds of gaming or 
attacks.&nbsp; At the Recommenders '06 conference last week, <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/" target="_self">Dr. Bamshad Mobasher</a> outlined two basic types of attacks: <span style="font-style: italic;">shilling</span> - trying to promote an item and <span style="font-style: italic;">nuking</span>
 - trying to demote an item.&nbsp;&nbsp; These types of attacks are 
quite real. The social site Digg is under constant attack by shills 
trying to get their story promoted to the front page.<br><br>Bamshad pointed to an example when a loosely&nbsp; organized group&nbsp; who didn't like evangelist Pat Robertson managed to <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-976435.html" target="_self">trick the Amazon recommender</a> into linking his book "Six Steps to a Spiritual Life" with a book on anal sex for men.<br><br>Bamshad
 suggest that one&nbsp; way to defend against shills and nukes is to 
create hybrid recommenders - recommenders that not only use social data 
but some inherent measure such as text or acoustic similarity.&nbsp; 
These types of systems are typically more robust than pure social 
recommenders.<br><br>Bamshad highlighted some other ways that 
recommenders can be protected against these attacks.&nbsp; As 
recommenders become a part of every day life for us all, making sure 
that the recommenders are giving honest recommendations will be 
increasingly important.<br><br>
