				I've had my iPhone for about 5 months now. I really like having the 
web in my pocket all of the time.  But when I take my nightly walk, I 
often leave my iPhone behind and bring along my dusty old 3rd generation
 iPod.  My iPhone, with its smaller memory, never seems to have the 
right songs on it.  I've tried to make smart playlists that freshen the 
iPhone with new tracks while keeping many of the old favorites - but it 
always seems that when I'm a couple of miles from home I get a hankering
 for a song that just isn't on my iPhone.  And so I bring along the big 
old iPod. With its 9,000 tracks, it almost always has what I'm looking 
for.  
<p>
I make my living thinking about how to use technology for organizing and
 discovering music. If I can't keep my iPhone fresh with the music that I
 want to listen to, then it is probably hard for most other people too. 
  It is just too hard to manage a device that can't hold all my music.  
So I'm hoping that the next generation iPhone will have much more 
memory.  I'd really like to see the iPod classic combined with the 
iPhone - 160gb of music would be iPhone heaven.

<p>I've more or less decided that 32GB is the minimum based on the fact 
that I'm pretty content with the capacity of my current 40GB 4G iPod. Of
 course if I got a touch or an iPhone I'd take up space with videos and 
the like too. </p>

<p>Would an alternative be to turn your logic on its head and get along 
on your walks by thinking and planning what you want to listen to before
 you set off? It's an extra discipline, I admit, but not one that may 
have benefits as well as costs. </p>


<p>I get by just fine with a 500 MB iPod Shuffle (my 2G iPod died years 
ago). Every time the battery needs to be recharged (after about 10 hours
 of play), I refresh the music on the iPod -- mostly with my latest 
emusic downloads, plus any new CDs I've acquired recently. Do I have 
instant access to whatever song I want wherever am I am? Obviously not. 
But I've found this is quite a satisfactory way, first, to make sure 
that what's on my iPod doesn't go stale, and, second, to work through my
 'in tray' of new music. This works for my tastes and purposes -- 
others' mileage may vary.</p>

<p>David:  I find that discipline of picking my songs before I take a 
walk to be too hard.  First of all, any extra barrier (the 5 minutes to 
build a playlist and resync) could potentially derail my exercise 
completely (ah ... lets make a playlist ... hmm while its syncing lets 
check boingboing ... oy ... there's an interesting steampunk flashgame 
.. woah its midnight, time for bed). </p>


<p>A bigger barrier is that I can never pick what I want ahead of time. 
 It's like trying to pick Friday's meal on Sunday at the grocery store. I
 just can't do it (which is why we often have Pizza or Chinese on 
Fridays). Tonight is a good example, I started with a tour through my 
teen years - Rick Wakeman's Journey to the Center of the Earth, and 
ended up spending the evening scouring through all the live bootlegs of 
Keith Emerson playing the Moog and torturing the L-100.  I probably 
walked in extra 20 minutes waiting for the Carmina Burana and Bach  
quotes.</p>
