				Aardvark, our blog recommender that relies on<a href="recommendation_for_the_rest_of.html"> Project Aura</a>,
 our web-scale recommender has a crawler that builds a link map so we 
can derive the authority of a blog based upon the link structure of the 
blogosphere.    For fun, I built a link map of the top 60 or so most 
linked blogs at blogs.sun.com.  It is interesting to see all of the 
connections, and of course <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/">Jonathan's</a> is the most linked to blog of all.  Here's an excerpt, the <a href="http://support_files/_feedGraph.jpg">full version is pretty large</a>. There's a <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/resource/_hardCoreFeedGraph.pdf">totally hardcore PDF</a> as well that shows the link structure for the top 200 blogs.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				I've been writing a specialized web crawler for Aardvark, our blog 
recommender.  The crawler is fairly straightforward -  pull blog feeds, 
add them the the Aura DataStore, and look for URLs to other blogs. When 
the crawler finds a new URL it has to decide whether or not it should 
crawl that URL to look for blogs.  The first part of this decision is to
 check whether or not we've already crawled the URL.  This is simple 
enough for a small crawler - when a URL is crawled, toss the URL into a 
HashSet, and whenever it is time to crawl a new URL, first check  the 
HashSet - if the URL is already there, it has already been crawled, so  
it can be skipped.  However, this gets to be a bit trickier when the 
crawler wants to keep track of millions of URLs.  The HashSet will no 
longer comfortably fit in memory.  So what to do? We could keep the URLs
 in a sorted file that we could quickly search through, or we could use a
 database to store the URLs and construct a query to see if a URL is 
already in the database.   Or we can just use our search engine. As the 
old saying goes, when you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail
 - and since we have <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/searchguy/entry/minion_an_open_source_search1">a search engine</a>,
 to us, everything looks like a search problem.  And so with our trusty 
search engine in hand, we created a persistent hashset that can easily 
deal with millions and millions of members.  And the code was 
surprisingly easy to write.  Here are the core functions:

<pre>    /** adds a string to the persistent set */
    public void add(String s) {
        if (!contains(s)) {
            inMemoryCache.add(s);
            if (inMemoryCache.size() &gt; MAX_MEMORY_CACHE_SIZE) {
                SimpleIndexer indexer = searchEngine.getSimpleIndexer();
                for (String cachedString : inMemoryCache) {
                    indexer.startDocument(cachedString);
                    indexer.endDocument();
                }
                indexer.finish();
                inMemoryCache.clear();
            }
        }

    /** tests to see if in item is in the set */
    public  boolean contains(String s) {
        if (inMemoryCache.contains(s)) {
            return true;
        } else {
            return searchEngine.isIndexed(s);
        }
    }
</pre>

The code was surprising fast too.  With a million items in the set, a 
'contains' operation took a couple of hundred microseconds to execute.
<p>
So, this is one way you can abuse a search engine, (the other way is to make it crawl ;)

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Over the past few months, the Project Aura team has been building a 
web-scale recommender.  As an example of what one can do with Project 
Aura, we've implemented a blog recommender called Aardvark that uses 
Project Aura.  Aardvark crawls the webs looking for blogs and recommends
 stories to you based upon your interests.  We've found that blog 
recommender is an excellent example for recommendation - there's lots of
 things to recommend (we crawl millions of new stories in a week), 
there's high churn on the content (a post that is 5 days old is ancient 
history) and people seem to be genuinely frustrated with blog reading - 
either there are too many posts to slog through in a day, or it is hard 
to find where to start reading about a particular topic.  
<p>
To demonstrate some of the under-the-hood technologies of the 
recommender (document similarity, classification and autotagging), and 
to add a bit of sizzle to what can be a bit of a boring demo ("now let 
me show you 10 blog posts that you might (yawn) find interesting"), 
we've built a dashboard for Aardvark.  The dashboard is a 3D app that 
shows the status of the live running system.  Blog headlines scroll 
through the space as they are crawled from the web. 
</p><p>
</p><center><a href="http://support_files/_aura_dashboard_headlines.png"><img src="support_files/_aura_dashboard_headlines.png" alt="aura_dashboard_headlines.png" border="0" height="400" width="500">
</a></center>
<p>
Clicking on any headline brings up the story. We can look at the manual 
tags and autotags for the story, find similar stories, get 
recommendations and explore the topic space of the blogosphere through 
this interface.   Of course, this isn't the type of interface that 
anyone would use to read blogs on a daily basis, but it is a great way 
to show off what is going on behind the scenes in the recommender.

				It looks like <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> got a 
little taste of reality.  In today's blog post Andreas  reports "As part
 of our ongoing negotiations with rights holders, we have pruned the 
catalog. We’re sorry if this means your favorite artist is missing. Our 
long-term goal is to have all the music."  Sure enough, a search for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/search/beatles">The Beatles</a>
 results in just Beatles' covers, no real Beatles. It is hard to tell 
how deep the pruning is, but I really hope it wasn't too deep - one of 
Spotify's biggest value has been their  bottomless cup of music. I'm 
sure Spotify will be working hard to get the music back. (And don't tell
 anyone, but the Beatles still seem to be there, they've just been 
removed from the Spotify search index. All my old <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/plamere/playlist/5UeYUj6jwyVwzLbt4Z5mac">playlists that had Beatles songs</a> still play just fine.)

 is a high quality search engine called Minion.  Minion handles 
everything that has to do with Text for these projects.  In addition to 
traditional search, we use Minion for document similarity (the core 
technique used for  <a href="tagomendations_making_recommedations_transparent.html">Tagomendations</a>),
 item clustering, sense disambiguation, classification and autotagging. 
 Minion is a research-oriented search engine - meaning that it is 
designed to allow for all sorts of variations.  It is ultra-configurable
 and has a simple API.  The big news is that the process to open source 
the Minion engine is underway.  Steve Green (aka the search guy) has 
created a Minion project on Java.net - and soon, the Minion search 
engine will be available for all.

				<i>In my extreme busy-ness of last month, I missed this item.</i> In the spirit of the <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">NetFlix prize</a>, <a href="http://www.mystrands.com/">MyStrands</a> has issued a '<a href="http://recommender-startups.strands.com/">call for recommender startups</a>'.
 They are  looking for teams with an original, creative, viable and 
relevant recommender idea. Five finalists will travel to Lausanne 
Switzerland for <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/">RecSys08</a> where the 
final selection will be announced.  The winner will receive an offer of a
 $100,000 investment in their idea/company.
Unlike the NetFlix prize, the MyStrands prize is loan/investment whose  
terms are 'determined by Strands in its sole discretion.'  
<p>
I'm not in any position to participate since I don't meet the 
eligibility requirements (individuals or sole proprietors and privately 
held businesses), but if I did, I'd be a little cautious about 
responding to this call, since my cool recommender idea would be 
published in a public forum - where anyone could see it and copy it. On 
the other hand, if I had a good idea, that was hard to duplicate or had 
some secret sauce - this might be just the thing to give me a year or 
two to turn it into the next Google.

				There's an interesting story in the Washington Post about CBS's plans for Last.fm. 
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/17/AR2008041703719.html"><em>CBS Interactive's Quincy Smith On Re-Org: 'More CBS Corp. Firepower Focused On Interactive' - washingtonpost.com</em></a><em>:
 "Last.fm: It's almost a year since CBS plunked down $280 million for 
the UK music recommendation start-up and Smith knows he needs to deliver
 on all that promise. Last.fm has been growing rapidly on its own and 
has been given start-up like breathing room but it's time to bring it 
more into the fold. As we've written here before, Last.fm also needs 
more U.S. traction. Yes, Smith said, they bought Last.fm in part because
 of its strong international appeal. 'But it's our job, frankly, as a 
corporation, to make them more valid in the United States.' To that end,
 CBS will ramp up on-air promos with 'a lot more call outs' starting in 
May and, very soon, Last.fm will get its own CMO 'charged with plugging 
them more into the CBS mainstream.' In late May, CBS will start sending 
viewers of certain shows to the show's music on Last.fm. 'The downside 
of Last.fm right now, from my perspective, has nothing to do with the 
service itself ... the question is how do you blow it up and make it a 
major media brand in the United State?' Last.fm is working with CBS 
Interactive's Entertainment unit. As Smith put it, 'CBS has done much 
less of a job with Last.fm than Last.fm has done with Last.fm.'"</em></p><em></em>
No doubt going mainstream with Last.fm is necessary for CBS to justify 
their $280 million dollar investment - but for a site like Last.fm, 
going mainstream is really tricky.  Last.fm listeners tend to be highly 
engaged music fans - whose taste runs to less mainstream music - you are
 more apt to find artists like Radiohead, Arcade Fire and the Postal 
Service in the top ten at Last.fm compared to the mainstream pop artists
 like Mariah Carey and Miley Cyrus that populate the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&amp;f=Pop+100">Billboard Pop 100</a>.
  As Last.fm goes mainstream, there is going to be a culture clash as 
the mainstream listeners collide with the old-school last.fm listeners. 
 Teenyboppers (and their angry parents) will wonder why <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hannah+Montana/+tags">Hannah Montana is tagged</a>
 with 'hardcore death metal' and 'lesbian'. Old-school last.fm listeners
 will leave for alternative sites as last.fm loses its focus as the best
 site to discover new indie and alternative music.   It's Digg all over 
again. As<a href="https://mashable.com/2008/02/05/digg-tech-section-analysis/"> Digg went mainstream</a>,
 it lost its focus on technology - and all the hard-core tech readers 
went back to slashdot.  The problem for Last.fm is that as it goes 
mainstream, it risks losing much of its core audience - the highly 
engaged music fan - and this user base of hard core music fans is one of
 Last.fm's biggest asset.

Companies like Google have spent years fighting search engine optimizers
 that will try to inflate the search rankings in exchange for money.  
The next wave of this foolishness is upon us - recommender engine 
optimizers. Companies will take your money in exchange for inflating the
 playcounts for your tracks.  For $747 a company called Tune Boom will 
increase the playcounts on your MySpace tracks by 300,000.  The <a href="http://tuneboompro.com/">tuneboom pro</a> site just reeks of sliminess:

</p><blockquote>More Plays Get You Attention. It's the Number One Factor
 To Get On The MySpace Charts! While Having Lots Of Friends On MySpace 
Is Important - It's Only Useful If You Have Targeted a REAL Fan Base - 
It's Proven That the Very First Information Looked At Are Your Song 
Plays! It ALL Starts With The Plays!

*Important: Don't let fans come to your page and see 20, 30, or 50, 
plays! People like to be a part of something big and don't want to miss 
out. When they see a high song play count and see that your song plays 
are increasing, they will be more likely to click and listen to your 
music and become friends and fans. </blockquote>

				In the TED Talk <a href="https://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/246"> Releasing the music in your head</a>,
 Tod Machover talks about new ways for people to interact with music. 
Tod argues that music is not just for listening. Everyone can create 
music, given the right tools. Tod builds systems that allow people to 
interact with music, experiment with music and even to perform music, 
even without formal music training.   
Tod introduces <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/view/id/216">Dan Ellsey</a> -a composer with cerebral palsy who uses Hyperscore to write and perform his music.  It's an interesting talk.

			<h3><a href="how_to_build_a_web.html" title="permalink">How to build a web-scale recommender</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				There are lots of challenges in building a good recommender system -
 one challenge is dealing with the scale.  A good recommender needs lots
 of data - the more the better. The best recommenders - like those at 
Amazon or Netflix have billions of taste data points for millions of 
users.  <a href="https://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> collects a half-billion  
scrobbles in a month.  More data is good - Amazon, Neflix and Last.fm 
are known for their good recommendations and that is mainly because they
 have so much good data.  But dealing with this data can be a challenge.
  Sites like Last.fm  are having to become experts at dealing with <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2008/04/01/hadoop-summit-2008-creating-new-infrastructures-for-big-data">Big Data</a> just so they can generate good recommendations.
<p>
Building a system that is ready to collect so much data and process it can be a challenge.  It is certainly a challenge for <a href="recommendation_for_the_rest_of.html">Project Aura</a>.
 We want to build a system from the ground up that is ready for all of 
this data.  Building such a web scale system that is highly reliable, 
fault tolerant and allows us to easily expand our computing capacity 
without re-architecting the system is not easy.  But luckily we have a 
secret weapon that makes it easy (well, easier) to build a web-scale 
recommender. That secret weapon is Project Caroline.  
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.projectcaroline.net/main/">Project Caroline</a> is a
 research program developing a horizontally scalable platform for the 
development and deployment of Internet services. The platform comprises a
 programmatically configurable pool of virtualized compute, storage, and
 networking resources. With Project Caroline we can develop services 
rapidly, deploy frequently, and automatically expand or contract our use
 of platform resources to match changing runtime demands.  In some ways,
 it is like Amazon's EC2 - in that allows for elastic computing across a
 number of networked computers, but Project Caroline works at a higher 
level - instead of dealing with linux images - you work with grid 
resources such as file systems, databases and virtualized containers for
 processes.  It is really quite easy and flexible to use.  Rich Zippel 
describes <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/zippel/entry/project_caroline">Project Caroline in his blog </a>as: <em>
 a really cool platform that allows you to programmatically control all 
of the infrastructure resources you might need in building a 
horizontally scaled system. You can allocate and configure databases, 
file systems, private networks (VLAN's), load balancers, and a lot more,
 all dynamically, which makes it easy to flex the resources your 
application uses up and down as required.</em>"
</p><p>
Project Aura consists of a set of loosely coupled components that use 
Jini for service discovery and RMI for IPC.  The heart of the system is a
 distributed datastore that allows us to spread our taste data and the 
computation associated with the data over a number of compute resources.
  Feeding this datastore are a set of webcrawlers and on top of this sea
 of components we have a set of web services and web apps for 
communicating with the outside world.   Getting this system to run on a 
local set of computers in the lab was a daunting task - with all the 
typical troubles of custom startup scripts, missing environment 
variables, processes registering with the wrong RMI registry, etc.  All 
the typical things that can go wrong when trying to get a lots of 
computers working together to solve a single problem.  Based upon this, I
 really thought we were going to have lots of problems getting this all 
running on Project Caroline - but instead it was a straightforward, 
process.  In about a day, <a href="http://research.sun.com/people/mybio.php?c=257">Jeff</a> was able to get all of Project Aura running on Project Caroline.
</p><p>
I was worried that once we started to run on the Project Caroline grid, 
we would lose some of ability to interact with our running system.  I 
was worried that we wouldn't be able to monitor our system, look at log 
files, restart individual components, or tweak a configuration - but 
that is not the case. Project Caroline has a grid accessor tool lets us 
take total control of the grid-based Project Aura. We can control 
processes, configure the network, interact with the filesystem (we can 
even use webdav to 'mount' the Project Aura filesystem on a local 
machine). Interacting with Project Aura when it is running on the grid 
is easier than when it is running locally. All the control is via a 
single interface - its very nice.  

</p><p><img src="support_files/_gridaccess2.png" alt="gridaccess2.png" border="0">
</p><p>
Now that we have Project Aura running on top of Project Caroline - I'm 
getting used to the idea of having 60 web crawling threads feeding a 
16-way datastore that is being continually indexed by our search engine -
 and  all of this is running across some number of processors - I don't 
really know how many, and I don't really care
</p><p>
I'm really excited about Project Caroline - this seems to be the right 
answer to the question that plagues anyone who is developing what they 
hope will become the next YouTube - How do you build and deploy a system
 that is going  to scale up if and when you get really popular?

				<p>Brian Zisk and friends have already scheduled a followup to the very successful <a href="http://sanfranmusictech.com/">SanFran MusicTech Summit</a>
 The summit will be on May 8th, right after the 50th anniversary of NARM
 (the National Record Merchandising Association).  Note that this also 
happens to be right in the middle of JavaOne week, so if you are geeking
 out at one conference, you are just a cable car ride away from the 
other.   I'm going to JavaOne, and that will no doubt keep me busy all 
week, but if I do get tired of hearing about yet another closures 
language extension for Java, I may try to sneak over to the summit. 
They've already signed up a good set of <a href="http://sanfranmusictech.com/speakers.html">speakers</a> for the summit, so it is sure to be an enriching experience.</p>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				I've started using <a href="http://www.listiply.com/">Listiply </a>  a site for sharing <a href="https://spotify.com/">Spotify</a>
 playlists.  When I'm jonesing for some new music I just pop over to 
Listiply, pick a playlist that sounds interesting and fire it up. Right 
now I'm listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/philip/playlist/0h45AqlMwPca5ATZ6Mb2by">Svängigt, jazzigt, elektroniskt </a> - which is filled with music I've never ever heard of - but it is really good to listen to while working.  
<p>
Everyday I become a bigger fan of Spotify. It is just great to have a 
seemingly bottomless collection of music to chose from. By creating URLs
 to everything (tracks, artists, albums and playlists), Spotify is 
enabling sites like Listiply. By adopting standards like <a href="http://xspf.org/">XSPF</a>,
 Spotify playlists will play well with others. And Spotify is fast.  It 
feels faster than my iTunes does, despite the fact that the music 
Spotify is serving is probably thousands of miles away, while iTunes is 
serving music and metadata right from my hard-drive.  It is not hard to 
understand why people are going to <a href="http://www.i-wanna-get-a-spotify-invite.net/">extreme lengths</a> to get a Spotify invite.
