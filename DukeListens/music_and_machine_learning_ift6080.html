	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Next week I am going to visit the University of Montreal to give a talk at Professor Eck's '<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Epift6080/en/index.html">Music and Machine Learning</a>'
 course.&nbsp; Doug asked me to suggest a paper or two to serve as 
background reading.&nbsp; Instead, I'll describe the prerequisites right
 here in this blog entry.</p><p>I'm going to talk about music discovery 
and recommendation.&nbsp; Since the course is about music and machine 
learning, naturally I'll talk about how we can use some of the automated
 techniques such as music classification and music similarity to improve
 recommendations. But before we get there I want to put the machine 
learning bits into a larger framework of music recommendation and 
discovery.&nbsp; To fill out some of this background and to get you 
thinking about music recommendation,&nbsp; you have two pre-class 
assignments:</p><p>The first assignment is to visit and use the following music recommendation/discovery sites:<br> </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.last.fm/dashboard/">Last.fm</a> <br>
  </li><li><a href="https://www.pandora.com/">Pandora </a><a href="http://ilike.com/"></a></li><li><a href="http://ilike.com/">iLike.com</a> <br></li><li><a href="http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/">Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.musicovery.com/">Musicovery</a><br>
  </li><li><a href="http://www.owlmusicsearch.com/">Owl Music search<br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes</a> <br></li><li><a href="https://hypem.com/">Hype Machine</a> <br></li><li><a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a></li></ul><p align="center">(<i>Update</i>: Note that Pandora might not work in Canada, <a href="http://globalpandora.com/">GlobalPandora</a> might work, but then again it might not) <br></p><p>For each site think about:</p><ul><li>What technique does the site use to help you discover music?</li><li>How far into <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/">the long tail</a> does the site get you?</li><li>How deep is the catalog of music?</li><li>How central is music recommendation and discovery to the site?</li></ul><p>The
 second assignment is to post a comment to this blog entry that 
describes how you made your most recent music discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I'll post the description of my most recent discovery to kick things 
off.<br></p><p>(note, if you are not taking the class, but just happen 
to be reading this blog, you don't have to do the homework, but you can 
if you want).</p><p>Update:&nbsp; I've <a href="http://mediacast.sun.com/users/lamere/media/music_recommendation_is_broken">posted the slides for the talk.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>

<p>My most recent discovery is Kate Havnevik.  I discovered Kate by 
listening to Pandora.  I was listening to Pandora's "Bjork" radio, which
 plays music that sounds similar to Bjork.  Over the course of a few 
days, Kate's song 'sleepless' came on a few times. After a few listens I
 decided that I really liked it. I checked how Kate's wikipedia entry - I
 noticed that a number of her songs are featured in the television show 
"Grey's Anatomy". My high-school-aged kids really like that show, so 
Kate was my way to have a conversation about something that interests my
 kids (kind of sad really ...)</p>


<p>You can hear 'sleepless' in the Youtube fan video: </p>

<p>My last discovery that is worth talking about is a rap group from 
Quebec called Gatineau. I went to the "Festival Consonance", a small 
music festival in St-Hyacinthe, Qc. [<a href="https://www.myspace.com/consonancefestival%5D." rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/consonancefestival].</a> I already knew some groups that were there, but it was the first time that I was hearing about Gatineau. </p>


<p>I really enjoyed their show although I've never been much of a rap 
fan! It's probably the reason why it's the first discovery that came up 
to my mind, I discovered a new group that made me re-discover a music 
genre I've never liked before.</p>

<p>Most of my music recommendations have come through a weekly podcast 
from CBC Radio 3.  I hear new artists on their weekly podcast every 
week, so it's hard to pick just one.  I think the one that's had the 
biggest impact is an indie artist from Halifax, Rich Aucoin.  His music 
is great, and as a bonus it syncs up with "The Grinch who Stole 
Christmas" quite nicely.</p>

<p>Quite a few of my recommendations come by seeing the bands that open 
for artists I’m already a fan of.  The most recent example was Au Revoir
 Simone, a charmingly twee band from Brooklyn who opened for Jens 
Lekman, an equally charmingly twee singer from Sweden.  Sometimes this 
is more fruitful an area of discovery than others, I suspect this has 
something to do with whether the headlining artist or the promoter 
organizes the opening acts.   </p>

<p>The only music recommendation site I've used enough to have an 
informed opinion about would have to be Pandora. I have mostly used it 
when I just needed some casual background music to work. One weakness of
 Pandora is that the catalogue isn't very big so you would sometimes get
 the same songs after a while. I did discover some nice music but none 
of which I became a big fan of.</p>


<p>I have a couple of friends who have more time than I to look around 
for new music. Luckily for me, they have a pretty good idea of what kind
 of music I like so they often recommend me new bands. Many of those end
 up on my MP3 player playing on repeat so for me, they are the best 
recommender I've got right now.</p>


<p>I'd also have to agree with Johanna about the opening bands. My latest discovery was an artist called Jason Bajada (<a href="https://www.myspace.com/jasonbajada%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/jasonbajada)</a> who was opening for Dumas (<a href="http://www.dumasmusique.com%29,/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dumasmusique.com),</a> both from Montreal.</p>

<p>My most recent interest in music is ambient electronic labels - many 
of which now offer free online compilations. The best of these that I 
have found is: </p>


<p><a href="http://www.sutemos.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sutemos.net</a></p>


<p>Sutemos is a small Lithuanian label that puts out deeply personal 
intelligent music that is both progressive in its use of new forms of 
synthesis/sampling and production, and at the same time classic as it 
reminds me of lush synthesized soundscapes of early FSOL. </p>


<p>I found this label from a friend of mine, Praveen Sharma (<a href="http://www.percussionlab.com%29,/" rel="nofollow">http://www.percussionlab.com),</a>
 who has been on their last two compilations, and whose music is 
absolutely brilliant. I met Praveen in NY at grad school, and have used 
his site as a starting point into a subgenre that I follow fairly 
consistently.</p>

<p>I think I'm too much of a casual listener (ie passive) to discover 
things through a recommendation system. Music is often an enjoyable  
backgroung thing, unless it's a piece I already know and like. This 
means I'm never giving feedback to the recommender, apart from some 
skips. I'm also not a frequent enough user to get to hear the same new 
song a few times and start being conciously curious about it.</p>


<p>So my (few) recent discoveries happened through the good ol' buddy system. Here's a friend's band I recently discovered:<br>

<p>Thumbs up for a great presentation! It was a complete overview with 
concepts seamlessly introduced. I especially enjoyed seeing how I fit in
 the different kinds of users and what a good recommendation might be 
(with the roles of familiarity, novelty, willingness to invest in 
discovery and so on). Thank you!</p>
