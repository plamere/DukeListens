				<p>The Music Information Retrieval Community is quite a diverse 
collection of researchers.&nbsp; There are musicologists, librarians, 
traditional NLP folk, plus the signal processing and machine learning 
geeks.&nbsp; The ISMIR 2008 call for papers lists around 30 topic areas 
including such diverse topics as compression, computational musicology, 
music recommendation, score following and performance analysis. This 
year's ISMIR is putting a 'singular premium' on submissions that span 
two or more disciplines. Clearly topic diversity is important to our 
research community.<br> </p><p>I suggest that our the name of our 
discipline&nbsp; 'Music Information Retrieval' may be too constraining, 
and as such is reducing topic diversity.&nbsp; To me, the term 'music 
information retrieval' constrains our discipline to tasks that extract 
information from a body of music.&nbsp; The term seems to eliminate from
 consideration a number of interesting topics including automatic 
accompaniment, track alignment for playlisting, compression, automatic 
annotation.<br></p><p>This sentiment was echoed at the recent meeting of <a href="http://thejingler.com/">NEMISIG.</a>
 There were a number of researchers interested in tasks such as 
automatic scoring of personal photo and video streams, making new 
devices that allow people to directly affect the music that the are 
listening to, making new music from old (such as the <a href="http://thejingler.com/">jingler</a>), reproducing performances of great (but dead) musicians.&nbsp; These problems are not strictly information retrieval. </p><p>If
 we want to increase topic diversity in the MIR community perhaps it is 
time to change our name to something that better describes the research 
that is taking place in our community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I humbly 
suggest that the term 'Music Intelligence Research' is a better 
description of our research community.<br></p>

<p>Paul, you suggest that "the term 'Music Intelligence Research' is a 
better description of our research community." I strongly support the 
general idea. In fact, for three years in a row, I proposed to the ISMIR
 Steering Committee that we change the phrase to "Music Information 
Research". At our meeting in Vienna, I pushed it hard, but -- to put it 
mildly -- I got little support from the rest of the committee! But I'm 
no longer a member of the SC, just of the community... Yes, there are 
arguments against the change, but I thought (and still think) they're 
pretty weak. Of course either your form or mine would preserve the ISMIR
 acronym that has become so well-known.</p>

<p>I like 'music information research' just as much as 'music 
intelligence research'.  What were some of the arguments against the 
change?  Was there concern that we may lose some of the library science 
folks, or perhaps that we would get swamped with synthesis technology?  
I'm very curious.</p>

<p>I remember Michael Fingerhut calling for similar name changes even as
 far back as 2001/2002.  I think his proposal at the time was "Music 
Informatics" as opposed to "Music Information". </p>


<p>But looking at the wikipedia page for Information Retrieval, we see this definition (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval%29:" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_retrieval):</a></p>


<p>"Information retrieval (IR) is the science of searching for 
information in documents, searching for documents themselves, searching 
for metadata which describe documents, or searching within databases"</p>


<p>So if you think about it, a lot of the subject areas that you mention
 are forms of (music) information retrieval.  Music recommendation is 
the problem of finding songs that you would be interested in hearing, 
from a database of documents.  Score following is the problem of 
searching for notes/chords within a single document, i.e. searching for 
where in a score the note that I am currently playing belongs.  
Performance analysis is the problem is searching for stylistic cues and 
variations within a single document.</p>


<p>Information retrieval, as a discipline, encompasses all these various areas.</p>


<p>The problem, IMHO, is not with the term "IR".  It is with the public 
understanding of IR in the post-Google world.  The mindshare that web 
search engines, let's say Google in particular, has overtaken means that
 most people have come to think of IR as having only the "search for 
documents in a collection" definition.   But that just isn't true.  
"Information" does not just mean "documents", and "retrieval" does not 
just mean "web or large document collection".  By doing automatic score 
transcription (audio to symbolic) one is actually "retrieving" note and 
chord and beat onset "information" from a song.  </p>


<p>So frankly, I see no problem with the name.  What I think we need to 
change is our understanding of what the name means.  Information 
Retrieval means so much more than "search".</p>

<p>Here is another definition, from the IST in the EU (<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/ist/ka1/administrations/publications/glossary.htm%29:" rel="nofollow">http://cordis.europa.eu/ist/ka1/administrations/publications/glossary.htm):</a></p>


<p>"Information Retrieval: The science and practice of identification and efficient use of recorded data."</p>


<p>So things like annotation definitely also fit within this scope  
(Annotation = identification).  And things like compression have always 
been a focus of (text) information retrieval research.  Think about a 
classic like Ian Witten's "Managing Gigabytes: Compressing and Indexing 
Documents and Images".  If you don't deal with information compression, 
the size of your indices are going to be unmanageable.  So I see no 
reason why compression should not be part of music information 
retrieval, too.  It will be a different type of compression.  But that's
 just because the data type is different, not because "information 
retrieval" is any different.</p>


<p>I do understand the concerns being expressed here.  But I want to 
offer a solution that returns the definition of "information retrieval" 
to its true historical glory :-)  All these things (compression, score 
following, etc.) are embodiments of information retrieval.  Web search 
has tended to obscure that fact.  </p>

<p>Sorry, just one more reference, then I'd be curious to hear what the 
rest of you think.  Here is the call for papers for the 2008 SIGIR 
conference:</p>


<p><a href="http://www.sigir2008.org/callforpapers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sigir2008.org/callforpapers.html</a></p>


<p>Check out a sample of the variety:</p>


<p>    * IR Theory (e.g., formal models)<br>
    * IR Architectures (centralized, distributed, federated, peer-to-peer)<br>
    * Content representation and indexing<br>
    * Interactive IR<br>
    * Classification<br>
    * Machine learning for IR (e.g., clustering, learning to rank)<br>
    * Information Extraction for IR<br>
    * Privacy in IR<br>
    * Metadata-based IR<br>
    * Social tagging<br>
    * Image IR<br>
    * Video IR<br>
    * Question answering<br>
    * Filtering (e.g., routing, collaborative filtering, topic tracking)<br>
    * Summarization<br>
    * Text mining (including speech mining, bibliometrics)<br>
    * Genomic IR<br>
    * Other domain-specific IR (e.g., legal IR, IR for chemical structures)</p>


<p>Think about the wide variety of machine learning, statistical 
processing, NLP "intelligence", social intelligence, library knowledge, 
etc. that are required to solve all these Information Retrieval 
problems: Collaborative filtering, summarization, Question Answering, 
Topic Detection and Tracking (e.g. automated following of a news story 
as it develops over time), social tagging, peer-to-peer IR.  </p>


<p>I mean, chemical IR is one of the topics!  And in order to do 
chemical IR, you'll have to be able to do analyses of structures and 
patterns in molecules, bonding affinities, etc.  </p>


<p>So if that sort of thing is still included within the domain of 
"Information Retrieval", I see no problem with continuing to call ISMIR 
work that does analysis of performer style "Music" Information 
Retrieval.  Know what I mean?</p>


<p>Thoughts?  Don?  Anyone else?</p>

<p>All good points, and well argued. As you say, the real problem is 
that when people hear the term 'information retrieval' they think about 
certain types of apps only.  Some people interpret MIR as applications 
that only consume music, they don't produce music.  </p>


<p>I was a bit concerned to hear researchers at NEMISIG apologize about 
their projects because they were not real MIR - because their app 
produced music.</p>

<p>Jeremy proposed 'a solution that returns the definition of 
"information retrieval" to its true historical glory :-) All these 
things (compression, score following, etc.) are embodiments of 
information retrieval. Web search has tended to obscure that fact.' And 
Paul responded that Jeremy had a point, and commented that "Perhaps... 
re-education is all that is needed." Perhaps. But re-education campaigns
 of any kind are notoriously difficult and expensive; who's going to pay
 for this one? </p>


<p>This situation reminds of the way the general public has always 
applied the term "song" to musical works of all kinds -- symphonies, 
string quartets, whatever -- to the great annoyance of classical music 
lovers like myself. I think using "song" so broadly is worse than using 
"information retrieval" so narrowly. Regardless, I don't think there's 
much hope for re-education in either case. But this is different because
 we're not concerned with the general public, only people in the field, 
right? Wrong. I think my proposal the ISMIR Steering Committee rejected 
addresses that objection quite well; I'll post it here shortly.</p>


<p>Paul said "Some people interpret MIR as applications that only 
consume music, they don't produce music." Surely _most_ people interpret
 it that way -- and they're not likely to change as long as they're 
using Google to _retrieve_ information.</p>

            <div class="comment odd" id="comment9">

                
<p>Heh, Don, I actually remember having to be corrected by you more than
 once about the "song" terminology issue, in 1998/1999 when we first 
started working on this.  At the time, we were working on the "search" 
type of information retrieval.</p>


<p>Since the field was so new, one of our problems then was coming up 
with terminology that appropriately captured both the music and the 
information retrieval aspects of what we were doing.  What we needed was
 a term that expressed the granularity at which we were working.  For 
text information retrieval, there was standard terminology: "document". 
 A document is an atomic unit of retrieval, the basic level of 
information segmentation, the basic unit of indexing.  We needed a 
similar term for music.  However, with music, we had many different 
types.  As you say, we had symphonies, quartets, cantatas, arias etc. in
 addition to all the 3-minute "songs" that Tim added by 2001/2002.  
Adding to that complexity was the fact that we weren't retrieving full 
symphonies; we were retrieving segmented symphonies, i.e. movements.  </p>


<p>What word should we have used, to refer to all this music in the same
 way?  What word is the equivalent of "document"?   I think the word 
that we finally agreed upon was "piece".  A symphony was a "piece" of 
music, a quartet is a "piece of music, a "song" is even a "piece" of 
music.</p>


<p>So why do I bring this up?  Where am I going with this?  </p>


<p>The point I am trying to make is that in those early days of Music 
IR, we weren't actually doing any "re-educating", as such.  We were 
inventing new terminology.  We were coming up with words that expressed 
both ideas from music as well as ideas from information retrieval.  In 
that sense, when I began using the word "song", I was not actually using
 the &lt;b&gt;music&lt;/b&gt; definition of song.  I was using one 
possible &lt;b&gt;music information retrieval&lt;/b&gt; definition, i.e.
 "musical document".  Now I'm not suggesting we should go back to "song"
 -- you were clearly against it.  I am only trying to point out that 
"song" meant something different in the MIR domain than in the music 
domain.  "Song" meant "atomic retrieval unit" or "document".  We were 
inventing new words.  I mean, if we had not been inventing terminology, 
even the word "piece" (of music) has problems when applied to the MIR 
domain.  Check out the WordNet definition of "piece": </p>


<p>'musical composition, opus, composition, piece, piece of music (a 
musical work that has been created) "the composition is written in four 
movements"'</p>


<p><a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=piece%20of%20music" rel="nofollow">http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=piece%20of%20music</a></p>


<p>From this reading, it seems like "piece" of music means an entire 
musical composition or work: the whole symphony.  Not just one movement.
  But then that becomes problematic, because the atomic "documents" that
 we were searching in OMRAS 1 were not only pieces, but subpieces.  We 
used movements of a symphony as "pieces".  So again, "piece" is just as 
wrong as "song", if we believe that "music" terminology should be 1:1 
mappable onto "music information retrieval" terminology.</p>


<p>I contrast this invention of new terminology with the proper 
contextualization of old terminology.  I think in the case of (music) 
information retrieval, we are not inventing new terminology.  We are 
inventing new subdomains of information retrieval.  Information 
retrieval has always meant more than just web search.  It's only in the 
last 10 years of this 40+ year field that people learned this new, 
Google-based definition -- and yet they learned it rather quickly.  I 
think they people can re-learn what information retrieval really means, 
just as quickly.  I don't actually think the re-education process will 
be that hard, because we are starting off with a definition that has 
historical roots.  We're not actually changing anything, we're not 
actually trying to invent new terminology, like trying to decide whether
 "song" or "piece" should mean "atomic music document".  </p>


<p>All we have to do is point out that things like TDT (topic detection 
and tracking) is a form of (text) information retrieval.  If people 
understand that, which I think they should, then it becomes trivial to 
draw the parallel between TDT and score following.  In TDT you follow a 
particular story over time; you want to make sure that your information 
need "syncs up" with the flow of news "documents", that you hit every 
documnt relevant to your need, even if the story starts to change as new
 information is revealed.  With score following, you want to make sure 
that the notes you are currently expressing (as which Chris Raphael 
plays the oboe) "sync up" with the flow of notes and chords from the 
"piece" of music.  If people understand that TDT is IR, then they should
 easily understand that score following is MIR.</p>

<p>Don, you write:</p>


<p>"I think my proposal the ISMIR Steering Committee rejected addresses that objection quite well; I'll post it here shortly."</p>


<p>Please, do post it, because there is probably something that I am not
 understanding about what you are saying.  I'd like to understand it 
better.</p>


<p>BTW, it's nice to have these old-time discussions with you again! :-)</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for the discussion, Don.</p>


<p>I see where you are coming from with the name.  Even though 
Information Retrieval does mean all these other things, someone might be
 put off, and not submit or investigate the conference further, because 
the current meaning of IR has changed to mean "to Google".  </p>


<p>But still, I think there are enough clues in the title, even still.  
For example, "music" and "information" are still there.  And that should
 be enough to hook an interested researcher or practitioner enough to 
look at the Call for Papers.  And the CFP does go on to explain all the 
various areas that ISMIR covers.. the Chris-Raphaelian score following, 
the social tagging, the traditional searching, etc.  </p>

<p>Whether the name of the conference has enough clues to hook an 
"interested" researcher depends on the definition of "interested". I'm 
pretty sure that some people won't look into a conference on "music 
information _retrieval_" who would look into one on "music information 
_research_"; to me, the question is how many, and I tend to think quite a
 few. I'm so overloaded with information, I make an awful lot of snap 
decisions on what to follow up on, and I don't think I'm unusual that 
way.</p>


<p>Besides, even insiders get confused! Why else did Elias Pampalk (in 
his list of music IR dissertations) leave out so much of what ISMIR 
accepts? Elias, are you reading this? I suppose I should post this on 
_his_ blog :-) ...when I have time.</p>

<p>Yes, I would like to ask of Don which dissertations he is thinking 
of.  Related to that, I would like to ask Paul if he could point to 
examples of work from the NEMISIG group that were worried about not 
being "true" MIR.  Paul, in what areas were the concerns?  Are they 
similar to the areas that Don will identify, for MIR dissertations?  (No
 need to give names, just describe the broad types of work.)</p>

<p>I can't remember if any of the NEMISIG attendees specifically 
expressed doubts about whether they were "real" music information 
retrieval.  But, thinking back over the morning's presentations, it 
seems like most of the research groups had at least one project that 
wasn't information retrieval in the sense of finding documents from a 
database, which is the main connotation of the phrase when I hear it.  </p>


<p>I can think of projects on transcription, games, accompaniment, 
interfaces for making music, TCNJ's interactive conductor simulation, 
synthesizing expressive music performances, music visualization, music 
and emotion, etc.   Such projects already make up a large part of the 
MIR field and I think that the name chosen to represent the field should
 reflect this.  I like music intelligence research and music informatics
 research as both of those are more inclusive of this part of the 
community.</p>


<p>Addressing Jeremy and Don's points about re-educating people, I think
 it's difficult to change the meaning or connotations of a name and 
generally what's necessary is the invention of a new name that doesn't 
have the same baggage.</p>

<p>But we are not playing games with music just to play games, right?  
The game is not just a game.  We are not going to sell it to Milton 
Bradley or to Hasbro, and people aren't just going to play it at 
parties.  We are doing something like the Luis van Ahn ESP game to get 
better tags/labels out of people, am I correct?  The games are designed 
to elicit some sort of human intelligence related to the music.  And the
 reason we are trying to get better tags/labels/intelligence out of 
people is because we want to be able to use those labels to do music 
recommendation, music classification, or music search.  </p>


<p>That's what information retrieval is!  It is any method that supports
 the organization of information.  Not just ranked list search.  That 
includes indexing, information representation, compression, storage, 
visualization, similarity functions in support of score alignment, 
similarity functions in support of recommendation, analysis, modeling, 
etc.  There is no name change needed.  As long as it is in support of 
the goal of allowing us to get a better handle (better 
understanding/organization) on music information, then it is IR.  So the
 game is not an end unto itself.  It is the means to an "information 
retrieval" end.</p>


<p>Now, if on the other hand the ultimate goal is not to achieve some 
sort of better organization (tagging, visualization, search, 
recommendation etc.) of music, but rather to come up with games that 
people like to play, while socializing with each other, and no 
information is ever captured and reused, then I agree: We do need a name
 change.</p>


<p>But I don't think our scope is that broad.  </p>

<p>Let me just give one more example of the scope of information 
retrieval.  CMU has one of the top IR research labs in the U.S. Here is 
the list of their research projects that fall under the Information 
Retrieval category:</p>


<p><a href="https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Research/projects.html#ir" rel="nofollow">http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Research/projects.html#ir</a></p>


<p>And many of these projects have analogues in the music IR domain:</p>


<p>Adaptive information filtering -&gt; music recommendation<br>
Distributed IR -&gt; Playlist sharing <br>
Email classification -&gt; Music genre classification<br>
eRulemaking -&gt; Analysis and visualization of music structure (either on a per song or a per user collection basis)<br>
Briefing Assistant -&gt; Shenkerian analysis in support of music structure understanding</p>


<p>I won't go on.  But look at the remaining CMU projects: Javelin 
(question answering), REAP, and Utility-based information distillation, 
and you'll see how wide the definition of Information Retrieval really 
is.  </p>


<p>It is not just finding documents in a collection.</p>
