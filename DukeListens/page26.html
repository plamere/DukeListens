	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>If you have a large music collection you probably know all about 
messy metadata.&nbsp; Artist, song and album name misspellings are 
common.&nbsp; Missing or incomplete data are par for the course.&nbsp; 
Inconsistent numbering and formatting, improper internationalization, 
duplicates, partial albums, multiple encodings, compilations - all make 
this a very sticky problem.&nbsp; Now, imagine you are a music 
researcher with 100,000 tracks, or even imagine you are Last.fm with 
millions of tracks, all with messy metadata.&nbsp; The messy metadata 
gets in the way all of the time - it ruins recommendations and 
playlists, it confuses, and just makes you look clueless when you can't 
tell that ELP, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, 
EL&amp;P are all all the same band. &nbsp;</p><p>Last.fm has decided to 
take on this problem and solve it. But not just for themselves, but for 
the world. They are distributing an audio fingerprinter that will 
collect data on common misspellings for tracks, artists and albums. Soon
 they will be offering web services that you can use to clean up the 
data.&nbsp; This will be a boon to all of mankind.&nbsp; RJ describes 
the project on the last.fm blog: <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2007/08/29/audio-fingerprinting-for-clean-metadata">Audio Fingerprinting for Clean Metadata</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;I really hope this will tie in with the MusicBrainz database.</p><p><i>Update:&nbsp; </i>Elias points to<a href="http://lists.musicbrainz.org/pipermail/musicbrainz-users/2007-August/016640.html"> this post on the MusicBrainz forum</a> where Russ (of last.fm) clears things up: <br></p><blockquote><div align="left"><pre><i>We have no intention of dropping MusicBrainz (especially since it's <br>taken so long to get the license in the first place!). MB is a lot more <br>than just the fingerprinting: we think MB is a great source of metadata <br>- and the more metadata sources we have, the better. Our fingerprinting <br>services will definitely return MBIDs in the future.</i><br></pre></div></blockquote><div align="left"><pre><p><b>That's just super! Now hopefully 'the future' is 'real soon'.</b> <br></p></pre></div>

				<p><a href="http://www.idiomag.com/">Idiomag</a> gives you your "own
 personalised music magazine".&nbsp; Every day, Idiomag will select a 
few articles related to bands that you are listening to and present them
 with a&nbsp;<i> very slick</i> flash interface that resembles an 
interactive magazine that includes images, music, video and text.&nbsp; 
The content is not your typical music blog stuff (which, quite frankly 
can be of questionable quality), Idiomag licenses professional content a
 variety of sources including <a href="http://www.losingtoday.com/" target="_blank">Losing Today</a>, <a href="http://www.soundsxp.com/" target="_blank">Sounds XP</a>, and <a href="http://www.musicemissions.com/" target="_blank">Music Emissions.</a></p><p>&nbsp;<img src="support_files/idiomag.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p><p>How
 does Idiomag know what music you like?&nbsp; You just point it at your 
last.fm, MyStrands, iLike, or MOG account.&nbsp; They apparently will 
suck up your taste data (that sucking sound is the sound of 
terms-of-service licenses being violated) and use it to figure out your 
musical tastes.&nbsp; If you don't have one of those accounts,&nbsp; no 
worries, you can tell it a few bands that you like instead.<br> </p><p>&nbsp;Idiomag
 will make their money by selling ads targeted at their listeners. (I 
didn't see any ads during my tour of the site).&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;I 
like the slick interface of Idiomag - they've done a very nice job with 
that ... but I can't exactly figure out they picked the artists for my 
magazine: TV on the Radio,&nbsp; Lavender Diamond and Machine 
Head.&nbsp; I haven't listened to these bands in the last week (as far 
as I can remember).&nbsp; Idiomag doesn't tell you how they selected 
them (in fact they don't tell you very much at all - they don't even 
have a privacy or terms of use statement on the site as far as I can 
tell).&nbsp;&nbsp; I am extremely curious if they've licensed the taste 
data from iLike, mystrands, last.fm or MOG.&nbsp; Idiomag's usage of 
this data is clearly commercial - and is probably violating all sorts of
 terms-of-use unless they've licensed the data.&nbsp; But I guess that's
 the web 2.0 way of things ... build your site, take what data you need 
and worry about the terms after you've built a user base. <i>Thanks to Oscar for the tip!</i><br></p>

				We are building a&nbsp; system that is trained to predict social 
tags for music.&nbsp; Our system will try to 'learn' what social tags 
should be applied to an mp3 file based solely on the audio 
content.&nbsp; The system works rather well for most kinds of music, but
 we've been seeing some particular problems with music that is labeled 
'grunge'.&nbsp; Bands that you'd think would be labeled as 'strong 
grunge' - bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam - are only mildly grunge 
according to our system.&nbsp; This has been a bit of a mystery, until 
this week when we added a feature that lets us search through our 
predicted tag space - with this feature we can find the most 'metal' 
(Good Riddance, Atheist), the most 'folk' (Bob Dylan, Cat Power), and 
the most 'electronica' (aphex twin, Jake Fairley). &nbsp; However for 
the most 'grunge' we didn't see Nirvana, or Pearl Jam (nor even Courtney
 Love), instead the most 'grunge' artists were Johann Sebastian Bach, 
Charlie Parker, Glenn Gould and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.&nbsp; Clearly 
this isn't right - so we dug in to see what was happening.&nbsp; We 
looked at the training data for the 'grunge' tag - sure enough it was 
filled with non-grunge artists, classical, jazz and spoken word - so 
instead of learning 'grunge' we were learning randomness (and 
woe).&nbsp; Thierry quickly found and fixed the problem (it was a 
problem with how we were normalizing tag counts) - so now we are 
retraining a bunch of our tags - with hopefully even better results 
coming.&nbsp; Clearly though, we need to think a bit more about adding 
some basic sanity checks - so we don't happily go though life thinking 
Bach is grunge.<br>

				<p>One of the simplest ways to publish a playlist is in m3u 
format.&nbsp; This is just a list of files or URLS to mp3 files.&nbsp; 
Almost all music players support them.&nbsp; However, iTunes makes a 
botch of it.&nbsp; If you play an m3u file in iTunes, it loads the links
 to the songs, and then just tosses them into the main library list, 
plays the first song and then then plays the next song in your library, 
instead of the next song in the m3u playlist.&nbsp; In iTunes, M3Us 
become unusable. &nbsp; To deal with this, there's <a href="http://www.burroak.on.ca/m3u2itunes.html">M3U2Itunes,</a>
 a freeware helper application that fixes these problems.&nbsp; 
M3U2iTunes simply creates a single playlist named "M3U Internet
Stream" and places all songs from the downloaded m3u playlist into
the M3U Internet Stream playlist, and plays the playlist.&nbsp; It 
cleans up nicely after itself too, so you don't end up with hundreds of 
playlists in iTunes.&nbsp; The program is easy to install, with good 
instructions showing how to make finder and Safari use it instead of the
 default iTunes behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; M3U2iTunes is a good app to have.<br>&nbsp;</p>

I did quite a bit of coding over the weekend while off the 'net - which 
is a bit like walking the tightrope without a net, since I can't check 
in my changes into the code repository.&nbsp; This morning my app just 
stopped working&nbsp; - bad news - without any CVS history to save 
me.&nbsp; Ah, but then I remembered netBeans 6 has a new local history 
feature that lets you see your changes and revert to previous 'versions'
 of the code, even if you haven't checked the code in yet. &nbsp; With 
this feature, I was quickly able to find the place that I accidentally 
munged the web.xml file while trying to add some Security 
Constraints.&nbsp; I reverted to the working version and Voila! - I was

 floating around that suggest that Universal is partnering with Google

stories started from a Universal press release that listed Google as a 
participating vendor for its new DRM-free music offerings.&nbsp; This 
was an error - according to  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/business/2007/08/10/universal-music-download-biz-media-cx_lh_0810bizuniversal.html">Forbes</a>, what Universal really meant was that Universal would purchase Google ads to steer customers to music vendor <a href="http://www.gbox.com/">gBox</a>.
 &nbsp; gBox has nothing to do with Google (which is instantly obvious

Winehouse and directs the click-throughs to gBox where gBox sells a

				<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/tivo"><img src="support_files/UB_tivo_logo122906.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>&nbsp;</p><p>A
 few months ago, Amazon and Tivo rolled out their Unbox on Tivo. With 
AuoT, I can rent a movie from Amazon, have it downloaded to my 
TiVo&nbsp; so I can watch it on my TV.&nbsp; Amazon gave me $15 credit 
to try it out, so I finally gave it a go this week. &nbsp;&nbsp; I 
really like the idea of AuoT - select a movie from a huge collection of 
movies, pay a reasonable price and watch it immediately.&nbsp; Unlike a 
rental store, I don't have to make a special trip, nor do I have to 
worry about late fees, forgetting to put the disk back in the box, 
scratched/unplayable disks. And unlike Netflix, I get more immediate 
gratification - I don't have to try to guess what I am going to want to 
watch in a few days (I'm embarrassed to admit how long I had a Netflix 
envelope with Seven Samurai sitting on the TV waiting for me to be in 
the mood to watch it).&nbsp; Overall, the AuoT experience was Okay - I 
like the convenience but there are some problems:</p><ul><li><b>Selection</b>:&nbsp; there are less than 2,000 movies to chose from (compared to over 80,000 at Netflix)</li><li>&nbsp;<b>Price:&nbsp; </b>$3.99
 is higher than I pay for most movies at the video store - while the 
cost for Amazon to deliver the movie must be so much less than Netflix 
or the local VideoMat</li><li><b>Play Restrictions:</b> Once a movie is 
downloaded to my TiVo, I have 2 days in which to play it - and once I 
start watching it I have 24 hours to finish it before it is deleted from
 my TiVo.&nbsp; That's just stupid. The rental period should be longer 
(3 days at least), with no restrictions or forced deletions in that 
period of time.</li><li><b>Video Quality:&nbsp; </b>The picture for the 
most part was very good - better than broadcast, but not as good as DVD.
 There were some stuttering artifacts every once in a while.</li><li><b>Time to Download: </b>It
 seems to take about 2 hours to download a 2 hour long movie to my 
TV.&nbsp; The annoying thing is that you can't start watching a movie 
until it is completely downloaded.</li><li><b>No Recommendations:&nbsp; </b>Uncharacteristically,
 Amazon offered no recommendations as to what movie I should watch - 
they seemed to just list movies in order of popularity.</li></ul>I hope 
Amazon/Tivo adjust things a bit to make this a better experience.&nbsp; 
If they lower the price, increase the catalog size, and eliminate the 
stupid play restrictions, I'll visit them more often that the local 
Video store.<br><br>

nice panoramic photo of the lab.&nbsp; Click on it to see the full size
(and very large!) version.&nbsp; There
are lots of nice things to see in this shot.&nbsp; Everyone seems to have
nice dual flat-screen displays, a mix of Apple and PC workstations, lots of natural
light, people working together (except for poor Cory, all by himself in
the corner).&nbsp; It looks like a fun and productive space.&nbsp; <br></p><p><a href="http://support_files/ichlab.jpg"><img src="support_files/ichsmall.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a></p><p>This
 picture is of the working space - on my tour of CIRMMT last year, Ich 
showed me a whole lot more -&nbsp; the CIRMMT web page describes the 
various CIRMMT labs:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li type="disc">Lab 1 (36 m<sup>2</sup>): Hemi-Anechoic Lab. Measurements,
room acoustics, diffusion, instrument directivity, transducers
spatialization, and room perception in listeners.
</li><li type="disc">Lab 2 (36 m<sup>2</sup>): Critical Listening Lab. ITU
standard room with multichannel and stereo audio, critical listening,
evaluation, and technical ear training research.
</li><li type="disc">Lab 3 (28 m<sup>2</sup>): Performance and Recording
Lab. Recording of individual performers, motion capture measurements of
respirology and performer movements, virtual reality applications.
</li><li type="disc">Lab 4 (23 m<sup>2</sup>): Audiovisual Editing Lab.
Preparation of test materials, PR and demo preparation, content for
archiving, viewing/listening space.
</li><li type="disc">Lab 5 (52 m<sup>2</sup>): Multimodal Shared Reality
Lab. Audio, video, vibration capture and display and presentation,
broadband, high-resolution network communication space,
ultra-videoconferencing.
</li><li type="disc">Lab 6 (23 m<sup>2</sup>): Perceptual Testing Lab.
Experimentation on music and sound perception (will also double as an
additional audio editing suite).
</li></ul>They have some very nice resources and facilities.<br><p><i>From the CIRMMT webpage</i>: <b>The CIRMMT community</b>
is interested in interdisciplinary research related to the creation of
music in the composer's or performer's mind, the performance of music,
its recording and/or transmission, and the reception of music by the
listener. It is also interested in the ways in which vision, haptics
and touch interact with music and sound.&nbsp; CIRMMT seeks to develop
innovative approaches to the scientific study of music media and
technology, to promote the application of newer technologies in science
and the creative arts, and to provide an advanced research training
environment.&nbsp; <br></p>

				<p>I like to listen to music when I'm working. Often I will listen 
to music from Pandora or Last.fm using their flash-based players.&nbsp; 
This is great when I am processing email or browsing the web, but if I 
am doing serious work, especially when I am in Netbeans, none of the 
flash-players seem to cut it.&nbsp; It seems that whenever Netbeans is 
thinking hard (which is almost all the time with its new 
context-sensitive editor)&nbsp; every flash player seems to stutter and 
skip.&nbsp; The listening experience goes down the drain.&nbsp; I 
suppose if I had one of those new-fangled dual core laptops I'd be in 
good shape, but with my 2 year old Ferrari, I have to use a more 
traditional desktop music player like xmms to get a good, consistent 
listening experience from my laptop.&nbsp; </p><p>Sounds like it is time for an upgrade, now to convince my boss.</p><p>&nbsp;<i>Update:&nbsp; </i>What laptop do I have?&nbsp; It's and <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1827539,00.asp">Acer Ferrari 4005</a>, running Ubuntu Edgy Eft.</p><p><img src="support_files/01425sz1i9979200.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br>&nbsp;</p>

 a cascading style sheet to work properly to work properly is always 
difficult for me.&nbsp; Sometimes (most of the time) things just don't 
work they way I think they should.&nbsp; This problem gets magnified 
when working on a web app - the edit/build/deploy/test cycle can take 60
 seconds or more, add to that the problem of the browser or web server 
occasionally caching the CSS so I don't even see the changes that I 
thought I made and it can get downright frustrating.</p><p>&nbsp;Coming to the rescue is the <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">Web Developer Toolbar</a>.&nbsp;
 This firefox plugin adds a toolbar with lots of nifty tools useful for 
developing and debugging web apps.&nbsp; The toolbar has some really 
useful features for debugging CSS.&nbsp; Turn on "View Style 
Information" and whenever you mouse-over an element in your browser, it 
put a box around it and shows&nbsp; you the style information like so:</p><p><font face="courier new,courier,monospace" size="2">html &gt; body &gt; div #banner &gt; div .bannerStatusBox &gt; table .bannerStatusBox &gt; tbody &gt; tr &gt; td .bannerLeft</font></p><p>This can be very helpful if you are using a toolkit like GWT that attaches its own stylenames to widgets. </p><p>Perhaps
 the most powerful tool in the Web Developer Toolbar is the CSS Edit 
feature.&nbsp; This feature allows you to live-edit the CSS of the 
current page. Make a change to the CSS and instantly see how it affects 
the page.&nbsp; The edit/build/deploy/test loop drops from 60 seconds to
 0 seconds.&nbsp; It is an extremely useful way to debug and 
experiment.&nbsp; When you are happy with the updated CSS, you can save 
it back to your project directory, so that the next time you do the 
formal build/deploy your CSS changes will be there.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;There
 are lots of other nifty features in the Web Developer Toolbar. If you 
are doing any web development, I don't see how you can live without it.<br></p>

				In this<a href="http://www.nabble.com/Folksonomy-support-t4058426s2885.html"> forum thread</a>, Robert Kaye (in charge of mayhem at <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>),
 says that a new release of the MusicBrainz music metadatabase will 
include support for social tagging of music.&nbsp; That will a great 
addition to dataset, but I imagine that it will take along time before 
MusicBrainz has built up as rich a set of tagging data that Last.fm has 
accumulated. &nbsp; Hopefully, the MusicBrainz community will&nbsp; make
 it easy to tag by incorporating MB tagging seamlessly into various 
music players.&nbsp; It'd be interesting to see how these tags differ to
 the types of tags that are being applied by last.fm and qloud users.
