 is a site with a goal of doing for video what Last.fm and iLike do for 
music. ffwd uses collaborative filtering to create video channels that 
are customized for a user.
<p>
This week I received an email from ffwd where they excitedly claimed to 
have some new recommendations for me, including this set of channels 
that I should check out:
<img src="support_files/_ffwd-2.png" alt="ffwd-2.png" border="0">
</p><p>
Two of these seem to be rather general: Recommendations for 'business' 
and 'tv show' would be like the local convenience store recommending 
that I might want to buy some milk and bread. However, it is the third 
recommendation, the 'panties' channel that caught my eye, so to speak.  
 I didn't recall doing anything on ffwd that would trigger an 'adult' 
recommendation, so this particular recommendation was a puzzler.   I 
checked out my history on ffwd to see what they know about me to see if I
 could figure out why they gave me this particular recommendation. It 
turns out, ffwd knows only a little bit about me - I rated a few shows 
last year:</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_ffwd-taste.png" alt="ffwd-taste.png" border="0" height="231" width="335">
</p><p> Its just typical nerd TV - nothing that should trigger a 
recommendation for a tour of the nether regions.  More than likely, 
ffwd's collaborative filtering algorithm is just not dealing with sparse
 data very well, causing it to make freakomendations.  Unfortunately for
 ffwd, these aren't just bad recommendations, they are likely to be 
offensive to some.
</p><p>
Sure enough, a few days later, I had this email in my inbox:

</p><blockquote><p>
Subject: <strong>apology from the ceo</strong>
</p><p>
Dear plamere,
</p><p>
On behalf of the ffwd team, I apologize if our recent email 
recommendations didn't make sense, or worse, offended you. We are 
testing a new channel recommendation system and may have put it into 
service prematurely.
</p><p>
Most subscribers found the suggestions useful, but if you didn't, please
 be patient as we work out the kinks and simply respond honestly to the 
recommendations. By ignoring the mistakes, and clicking on the relevant 
suggestions, you will improve the system for you and all other viewers.
</p><p>
Again I apologize for any offensive recommendations and appreciate your patience as we improve our system.
</p><p>
Happy New Year!
</p><p>
Patrick<br>
CEO, ffwd
</p><p></p></blockquote>
And so it seems, I was not the only one of ffwd's users who received 
such an recommendation.  As corporate apologies go, this is not a bad 
one, but I don't like this bit "Most subscribers found the suggestions 
useful, but if you didn't, please be patient...". This seems to imply 
that if I took offense, it is really my fault, not ffwd's, since most of
 the ffwd subscribers didn't seem to be offended. If you are going to 
apologize, just do it, don't waffle or weasel about it.

<p>Clearly recommendations are not just tricky but also sometimes risky 
business. When I received the email apology from ffwd, I was reminded of
 Walmart's embarrassment a couple years ago when they directed people 
considering Planet of the Apes to look at DVDs with African-American 
themes.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Walmart recommendation of "if you like MLK you might like
 the Planet of the Apes" was a PR disaster for them.  Apparently, this 
recommendation wasn't due to a collaborative filter that ran amok, 
according to the Washington Post, it was a human error:</p>
