			<h2>Amazon Unbox on TiVo</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/tivo"><img src="support_files/UB_tivo_logo122906.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>&nbsp;</p><p>A
 few months ago, Amazon and Tivo rolled out their Unbox on Tivo. With 
AuoT, I can rent a movie from Amazon, have it downloaded to my 
TiVo&nbsp; so I can watch it on my TV.&nbsp; Amazon gave me $15 credit 
to try it out, so I finally gave it a go this week. &nbsp;&nbsp; I 
really like the idea of AuoT - select a movie from a huge collection of 
movies, pay a reasonable price and watch it immediately.&nbsp; Unlike a 
rental store, I don't have to make a special trip, nor do I have to 
worry about late fees, forgetting to put the disk back in the box, 
scratched/unplayable disks. And unlike Netflix, I get more immediate 
gratification - I don't have to try to guess what I am going to want to 
watch in a few days (I'm embarrassed to admit how long I had a Netflix 
envelope with Seven Samurai sitting on the TV waiting for me to be in 
the mood to watch it).&nbsp; Overall, the AuoT experience was Okay - I 
like the convenience but there are some problems:</p><ul><li><b>Selection</b>:&nbsp; there are less than 2,000 movies to chose from (compared to over 80,000 at Netflix)</li><li>&nbsp;<b>Price:&nbsp; </b>$3.99
 is higher than I pay for most movies at the video store - while the 
cost for Amazon to deliver the movie must be so much less than Netflix 
or the local VideoMat</li><li><b>Play Restrictions:</b> Once a movie is 
downloaded to my TiVo, I have 2 days in which to play it - and once I 
start watching it I have 24 hours to finish it before it is deleted from
 my TiVo.&nbsp; That's just stupid. The rental period should be longer 
(3 days at least), with no restrictions or forced deletions in that 
period of time.</li><li><b>Video Quality:&nbsp; </b>The picture for the 
most part was very good - better than broadcast, but not as good as DVD.
 There were some stuttering artifacts every once in a while.</li><li><b>Time to Download: </b>It
 seems to take about 2 hours to download a 2 hour long movie to my 
TV.&nbsp; The annoying thing is that you can't start watching a movie 
until it is completely downloaded.</li><li><b>No Recommendations:&nbsp; </b>Uncharacteristically,
 Amazon offered no recommendations as to what movie I should watch - 
they seemed to just list movies in order of popularity.</li></ul>I hope 
Amazon/Tivo adjust things a bit to make this a better experience.&nbsp; 
If they lower the price, increase the catalog size, and eliminate the 
stupid play restrictions, I'll visit them more often that the local 
Video store.<br><br>

<p>I've been trying Unbox a bit myself as well. I don't like the fact 
that its limited to Windows. Since I'm using Macs, that's a drag. I was 
able to use it since I do run Windows through virtualization. I think it
 would be nice if service providers stopped restricting use of their 
software to a specific platform. It seems like a programming copout.</p>


<p>I agree with you on the time limit. From the start, it's daunting to 
think I must watch the movie within 2 days. That's just stupid. Once 
these content providers wrench away usability decisions from the suits 
who are over-concerned with DRM, they will see adoption of their 
services rise exponentially.</p>

<p>Hey Paul, not sure where you got the two day limit idea from - I 
believe most movies are rentable for 30 days before they auto-delete? 
I've had  Unbox movies on my Tivo for a week or two before I watched 
them. And I do get Unbox recommendations - there is a link right on top 
of the Unbox main page ...</p>


<p>I do agree on the price - 3.99 is not something I'd pay too often. 
They had a few 99 Cent rentals in the beginning, not sure if they will 
continue to offer things like that. </p>


<p>I do however like the idea of buying episodes of Showtime shows for 
1.99 a buck. Just hope they will add new episodes of current seasons as 
soon as they air ...</p>

<p>I've been using Unbox a fair amount recently. Their office is one cube wall over, so I figure I should eat the dog food :).</p>


<p>I use a Mac as well, so I use the client under Boot Camp and Windows.
 I had a lot of problems with my first two rentals, but it has been 
mostly smooth sailing since then. On the PC side, you get 30 days to 
start watching, and then 24 hours to watch it. The 30 days is fine, but I
 wish I had more time to watch the movie, in case I get interrupted one 
night, or I want to go watch a part again to catch something I missed. I
 also wish they had a bigger selection, because I'm starting to run out 
of interesting movies :). A fair number are regularly discounted, in my 
experience.</p>
