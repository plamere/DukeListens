				If you live within a day's drive of Montreal, consider going to the <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eeckdoug/mmmlw2008/">Montreal Music and Machine Learning Workshop</a>.  The workshop is being held at the Université de Montréal on November 14 and is being organized by <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eeckdoug/">Douglas Eck</a>, <a href="http://mr-pc.org/">Michael Mandel</a>, and <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Evincentp/">Pascal Vincent</a>.
  The schedule will include a small number of long-format talks, a 
poster session, and plenty of time for informal discussion between 
machine learning and music researchers. You need not be a machine 
learning expert to attend! 
<p>
(And while you are attending, be sure to get Doug to show you their quarter million dollar piano!)

	<div class="entry-content">
				Halloween is coming, time to find a costume. If you go to Amazon and
 search for "terrorist costume", Amazon can't find anything, but they do
 suggest that you might try the related search 'arab costume' - 
suggesting that 'terrorist' is synonymous with 'arab'. 
<p>
<img src="support_files/_terrorist.png" alt="terrorist.png" border="0" height="129" width="579">
</p><p>
Of course, this isn't really the view of Amazon. They don't equate 
terrorists and Arabs. It just that they have an algorithm that looks for
 statistical patterns in searches that they use to suggest alternate 
searches.  This algorithm notices that the same people who search for 
'terrorist costume' will often search for 'arab costume'.  This related 
search that seems to equate terrorists with Arabs is just a reflection 
of society's prejudices. 
</p><p>
This isn't the first time we've seen a racist recommender.  Wal*Mart got into a little bit of <a href="https://boingboing.net/2006/01/05/walmart-apes-dvd-lis.html">trouble</a>
 when their recommender started to associate films about black historic 
figures like MLK with the movie Planet of the Apes. Since automatic 
recommenders are just reflections of the biases of the population at 
large, the recommenders become a mirror of our society.  If the 
recommender is giving racist recommendations, it is likely that the 
racism exists in the population at large.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				A few years ago, for fun, I wrote a mashup web app called <a href="http://www.snappradio.com/">SnappRadio</a> that would select and display images from Flickr related to the music you were listening to (on RadioParadise or Last.fm). 
My buddy, Sten, has just coded up a version of SnappRadio using JavaFX.  
<p> 
<a href="http://support_files/_36581911-969B-421C-90DF-27845492EED0.jpg"><img src="support_files/_36581911-969B-421C-90DF-27845492EED0.jpg" alt="36581911-969B-421C-90DF-27845492EED0.jpg" border="0" width="500"></a>
</p><p>
SnappRadio FX takes SnappRadio out of the browser and onto the desktop. 
 Sten is using lots of the cool features that are built into JavaFX such
 as timelines, keyframes, reflection.  Interestingly, although 
SnappRadio FX looks like a full 3D app, Sten says it really is a a 2D 
app - apparently JavaFX 3D doesn't exist yet.  Sten also points out that
 the JavaFX performance is rather unpredictable: "Four out of five runs 
of the app may be smooth sailing, and then I’ll get a run with two 
second pauses between frames. Whaa? I hope this is a by-product of the 
preview build and that 1.0 will be more consistent."
</p><p>
Sten says that he'll be posting the source code for SnappRadio FX in the
 future.  I'm really interested in seeing how the JavaFX code looks. 
</p><p> You can read more about SnappRadio FX, (as well as give it a try)  at<a href="http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sanderson/?p=28"> Sten's blog</a>. (And while you are there, you might as well add Sten's blog to your regular reading list - he's been <a href="http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sanderson/?p=27">writing</a> <a href="http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sanderson/?p=26">some</a> <a href="http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sanderson/?p=22">great</a> <a href="http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sanderson/?p=18">stuff</a> lately).

				Pandora has updated their <a href="https://www.pandora.com/on-the-iphone">iPhone app</a>
 - and it really shows.  I've been listening to Pandora on the iPhone 
over the last few days using nothing but the slow iPhone 1.0 edge 
network - and so far it works seemlessly - no stutters or pauses (except
 for an initial buffering of the very first song on a stations).  <p>

Pandora has done an excellent job at bringing their simple, one-button personalized radio to the iPhone.  Check out <a href="http://images-sjl-2.pandora.com/public/podcasts/2008/iPhone_1_larger.html">Pandora's demo video</a> to see  how it works.</p><p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Last.fm has added song lyrics to their site. You can now search for 
music based upon lyrics.  For example, lets find some songs about <a href="https://www.last.fm/music?m=lyrics&amp;q=obama">ThatOne</a>:

<img src="support_files/_lastfm-obamasearch.png" alt="lastfm-obamasearch.png" border="0" width="600">
<p>
This gives lots of results:
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_lastfm-obama.png"><img src="support_files/_lastfm-obama.png" alt="lastfm-obama.png" border="0" width="500"> </a>
</p><p>
When visiting the song page at Last.fm you are now given an excerpt of the lyrics, with a link to the full lyrics.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_lastfm-lyric.png" alt="lastfm-lyric.1.png" border="0" width="601"> 
</p><p>
Here's the lyric detail page:
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_lastfm-yesterday.1.png"><img src="support_files/_lastfm-yesterday.png" alt="lastfm-yesterday.1.png" border="0" width="500"></a>
</p><p>
The lyrics are a result of a partnership between Last.fm and <a href="http://www.lyricfind.com/">LyricFind</a>.  The <a href="http://www.lyricfind.com/20081008Lastfm.htm">press release</a> says over 800,000 lyrics have been included.  
</p><p>
Last.fm has done a nice job of integrating the lyrics into the website, 
but it would be nice if they could get them integrated into their 
standalone player.  It would also be really neat if they could start to 
include lyric similarity into their computation of artist and track 
similarity.  I'd like to be able to  build playlists and radio stations 
based upon lyric similarity.  (I did some experiments along these lines a
 while back with<a href="songs_that_make_you_swing.html"> fun results</a>).

<a href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> has just <a href="http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=238993">announced</a>
 music licensing deals with Universal, Sony, BMG, EMI Music, Warner 
Music, Merlin, The Orchard and Bonnier Amigo.  With those deals in 
place, Spotify has gone live. <a href="https://www.spotify.com/en/products/premium/">Premium access</a>
 (advertising-free, paid subscription) is available now (October 7), 
while free, ad-supported access will be gradually made available over 
the next few months. 
</p><p>
<em>Now the bad news:</em> Unfortunately, for those of us in the states,
 Spotify is only launching in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, 
Finland, Norway and Sweden. No word yet on when they will be launching 
here. </p><p> 
<a href="http://support_files/_spotify-help.png"><img src="support_files/_spotify-help.png" alt="spotify-help.png" border="0" width="600"></a>
</p><p>Spotify is a streaming internet music application that offers 
on-demand access to a seemingly unlimited amount of music.  In some 
ways, it is like iTunes - you can search and browse for music, create 
playlists, and play music by any artist with just a click of the mouse. 
 But Spotify is so much better than iTunes since it gives you access to 
millions of tracks (all perfectly legal). With Spotify you can share 
playlists with other Spotify users (and they can actually listen to 
them), you can even create collaborative playlists where multiple users 
can add tracks to the list.  Spotify also offers a Pandora-like radio 
mode that will give you an infinite playlist of music by similar artists
 (using AllMusic's artist similarity). You might expect that since 
Spotify is streaming music over the wire, that it would be slow and 
cumbersome - but to me, it seems to be as fast or faster than iTunes. 
When I click on a song, it starts playing immediately - with no stutters
 or drop outs (well except for that time when my wireless router was 
dying).  
</p><p>
In addition to the excellent music client, there's a lot of cool stuff going on in the Spotify back room as well. <img src="support_files/_spotify-deerhoof.png" alt="spotify-deerhoof.1.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" border="0" height="105" width="313">
 Every item (artists, tracks, albums and playlists) in Spotify has a URL
 associated with it. This makes it easy not only to share music but for 
third parties to build applications that use Spotify as the music 
engine. (We've done that here in the Labs with our <a href="the_aura_music_explaura.html">Music Explaura</a>
 - when you click on the little green play button you are playing music 
in Spotify). Spotify also provides web services to allow 3rd parties the
 ability to search the Spotify catalog for artists and tracks and 
resolve them to Spotify URLs.
</p><p>
The premium subscription costs £10 per month or £100 per year in the UK. It comes with these attributes:
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_spotify-premium.png" alt="spotify-premium.png" border="0" height="306" width="291">
</p><p> (Note that the premium subscription comes with two beta invites,
 so if you live in the USA, it is time to make a European friend). 
Spotify is also offering a <a href="https://www.spotify.com/en/products/day-pass/">day pass</a> - (£1 per day) for when you are planning that romantic dinner and you don't have enough <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3rfgbfpPSfXY40lzRK7Syt">Barry White</a> to get you through the night.

</p><p>
I've <a href="collaborative_playlists.html">written</a> about Spotify a <a href="woah_spotify_is_pretty_cool.html">few</a> <a href="listiply_playlist_sharing_for_spotify.html">times</a> <a href="linking.html">already</a>.
  Since then, the Spotify team has added lots of new features.  For 
instance, there's now a 'What's New' tab that highlights music that has 
been recently added to the catalog, along with some artist 
recommendations:
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_spotify-whatsnew.1.png"><img src="support_files/_spotify-whatsnew.png" alt="spotify-whatsnew.1.png" style="margin: 5px;" border="0" width="280"></a><a href="page5.html" http:="" blogs.sun.com="" plamere="" resource="" _spotify-zeitgeist.1.1.png=""><img src="./page5_files/_spotify-zeitgeist.png" alt="spotify-zeitgeist.1.1.png" style="margin: 5px;" border="0" width="280"></a> </p><p>
They've also added a zeitgeist page that shows you what is popular on Spotify (or just what's been popular for you).
</p><p>

</p><p>
Spotify is the closest thing there is to the celestial jukebox - with 
(nearly) all music available on demand.  I'm really excited to see where
 the Spotify team takes this. Congrats to the Spotify team for releasing
 such a great music app - (but don't spend too much time resting on your
 laurels - get back to work on those pesky music deals so that Spotify 
can be released in the U.S.!)

 to see what talks and panels I could find about music recommendation.  I
 found a number of interesting talks that were related to music 
recommendation, but none that seemed to answer the question about why 
music recommendation seems so broken and what is going to be done to fix
 it.  Since I know a bit about the topic, I decided that perhaps I 
should propose such a talk.  But I found out that I'm way too late ... 
the SXSW proposal deadline was July 11.  However, the SXSW organizer 
that I contacted said that there is still a very small chance that if I 
submitted something that it could be accepted. He indicated that 
although the voting on submissions is closed, that if my proposal <em>received some favorable comments</em>, that would help. So although it is a long shot, I decided it wouldn't hurt to submit something, so here's my proposal:
<ul>
<p>
 <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2146?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fq%3Amusic+recommendation"> I'm so sad, my iPod thinks I'm Emo.</a>
 - Music recommendation is broken - automatic music recommenders make 
mistakes that no human would ever make. In this talk, we will explore 
why recommenders make such dumb mistakes and we will explore some of the
 new ideas coming from recommendation and music researchers to help make
 music recommendations better.
</p></ul>
<p>
If you think it is interesting and may be something you'd attend at SXSW, I'd be pleased if you'd <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2146?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fq%3Amusic+recommendation">add a comment</a> to the proposal.
</p><p>
Here is a list of other SXSW panel proposals that are somewhat related 
to either music discovery or recommendation.  It looks to me like the 
most closely related panel is <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1118?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fdescription%3Amusic%2Fcategory%3ANew+Technology+%5Eslash%5E+Next+Generation">Music 2.0 = Music Discovery Chaos?</a>. This one does look interesting and I'd love to attend it, although I don't think it is going to be too research-oriented.
</p><ul>

 - Current music discovery techniques rely on human annotation and human
 behaviour to generate recommendations. We review current recommendation
 methods and take a in-depth look at new semantic recommendation 
methods, and discuss how both worlds can be combined to deliver an 
ultimately better music discovery experience.

 - Personalization technologies are all over the web now, with 
applications everywhere offering recommendations for movies, music, 
video, blogs and most anything else we might like online. Do any of 
these systems work, and if so how? Is “Discovery” the next “Search,” or 
just an excuse for behavioral targeting systems that compromise privacy?
 Finally… If you’re a site publisher interested in adding personalized 
recommendations, how do you pick a partner to help you get there, or 
strike out on your own and get the feature built????

			<h3><a href="the_nutsie_challenge_gnomes_vs.html" title="permalink">The nuTsie challenge - Gnomes vs. Geeks</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				In response to <a href="https://www.pandora.com/">Pandora's</a> recent <a href="http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2008/09/congressional_e.html">warnings</a> that it may go out of business due to the ongoing music licensing issues, <a href="http://www.nutsie.com/main">nuTsie</a> (yet another music streaming service) has issued <a href="http://www.nutsie.com/pandora_challenge">A nuTsie challenge</a>:

<ul>
The Challenge dares every Pandora user to try nuTsie for one day and 
then to let us know which service they prefer. If Pandora has more votes
 than nuTsie at the end of this October, nuTsie's own Dave Dederer, 
founding member of the rock band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presidents_of_the_United_States_of_America_%28band%29">The Presidents of the United States of America</a>,
 will write and record a witheringly sincere love song to Pandora's CEO,
 Tim Westergren, and put it on the nuTsie.com home page for a week. Dave
 invites Tim to reciprocate the bet.
</ul>

The folks at nuTsie do have a sense of humor: <em>The nuTsie Challenge 
is a creation of nuTsie's elite in-house think tank, the Music Gnome 
Project. The Music Gnome Project believes that music is magical and 
strange and unpredictable, not some geeky science experiment.</em>
<p>
However, I think Dave had better start tuning his guitar ... my nuTsie 
trial didn't go too well.  I started with alternative metal band '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_benjamin">Breaking Benjamin'</a>
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_nutsie-1.png" alt="nutsie-1.png" border="0" width="600">
</p><p>
nutSie was able to play a few tracks by Breaking Benjamin, but then took
 a hard left turn and started to play the Simple Symphony, by Benjamin 
Britten. Ouch! This was followed shortly thereafter by South African 
jazz vocalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sathima_Bea_Benjamin">Sathima Bea Benjamin</a>.  The nuTsie song transitions were giving me iPod whiplash as I was dragged through a number of wildy different genres.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_nutsie-2.png"><img src="support_files/_nutsie-2.png" alt="nutsie-2.png" border="0" width="600"></a>.
</p><p>
It looks like the Music Gnome project is having a bit of a hard time 
distinguishing between all of the different artists with 'benjamin' in 
their names.   That certainly would explain why they think that <em>music is magical and <strong>strange and unpredictable</strong>.</em>
</p><p>
I'll give nuTsie a fair trial for a whole day, but I suspect if nuTsie 
continue to make these very basic metatdata mistakes that Tim and the 
rest of the Pandora gang shouldn't be too worried - I suspect that in 
the war between the Gnomes and the Geeks, the Geeks will win.

			<h3><a href="the_sixtyone_a_musical_adventure.html" title="permalink">The sixtyone - a musical adventure</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				At ISMIR, I asked Anthony Volodkin, founder of the Hype Machine what music sites he was excited about. He pointed me to <a href="http://www.thesixtyone.com/?referred_by_username=plamere">thesixtyone</a>. I've been playing with thesixtyone for about a week now and Anthony is right, thesixtyone is really interesting.
<p>
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_61-1.png"><img src="support_files/_61-1.png" alt="61-1.png" border="0" width="600"></a>
</p><p>

The sixtyone is part music discovery site, part social music site, and 
part online game.  On thesixtyone, you listen to music (almost all of it
 by artists you've never heard of).  If you find something you like you 
can 'bump it' - (it's just like digging) - songs or artists that get 
bumped a lot hit the home page, where they get lots of visibility and 
lots of plays (just like Digg). Not only is getting to the front page 
highly rewarding for the artist, it also can be highly rewarding for you
 if you were an early 'bumper' of the track. That's because everything 
that you do on the site can earn you points. Visit the site every day, 
you get points.  Listen to music from 'the rack' (the new bin), you get 
points, bump a song that then gets bumped by lots of others, you earn 
lots of points.  Be the first person to bump a song that ultimately 
makes it to the front page - you get a boatload of points.  As you earn 
points, you go up levels, just like D&amp;D - and the higher your level,
 the more weight your opinion carries - higher level users can bump 
songs multiple times. You also get points for 'achievements' like 'disk 
jockey' if you attract lots of  others to your 'radio station'.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_61-2.png" alt="61-2.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" border="0" width="128">
I've really just scratched the surface - there is lots to do at 
thesixtyone - you can spend time looking for undiscovered gems, you can 
listen to the music that is been bumped the most, you can explore the 
'favorites' of other users, you can build playlists, you can
<img src="support_files/_61-5.png" alt="61-5.1.1.png" style="float: right; margin: 5px;" border="0" height="91" width="225">
create your radio station, you can comment on tracks (the comments get 
turned into little popups that sometimes appear when people listen to 
the song) - it really does feel a bit like a D&amp;D game - it is fun to
 notified via a little popup that you've just received some points or 
achieved some goal.  And while you are doing this, you are listening to 
music, of all sorts of genres. The music is mostly good to excellent 
(with some clunkers too).  And there are some big name artists - I've 
listened to NiN, Bjork, Jonathan Coulton and Daft Punk on thesixtyone.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_61-4.png"><img src="support_files/_61-4.png" alt="61-4.png" style="float: right;" border="0" width="300"></a>
thesixtyone developers have done a great job of making the site highly 
interactive. It is very highly polished, and is simply fun to use. The 
music player is integrated perfectly into the site, so no matter what 
you do, the music keeps on playing.  
</p><p>
thesixtyone is a fantastic place for new artists to get their music into
 the ears of listeners since listeners are rewarded for finding and 
bumping the newest music.  My friend, <a href="http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sanderson/">Sten</a>, uploaded some tracks for his band "<a href="http://www.thesixtyone.com/#/hungryfathers/">Hungry Fathers</a>" and within minutes their songs had been listened to by half-a-dozen listeners. That just doesn't happen on Myspace.</p><p>
</p><p>
It has been a long while since I've been excited by a new music site.  
Most 'new' music sites are just variations on the Last.fm theme - 
("Let's build a social community around music!") and there just isn't 
any need to do that anymore, Last.fm does it so well. But thesixtyone is
 really doing something different - they are making it easy, fun and 
rewarding to explore and discover new music.
</p><p>
<i> The observant browser will notice that my link to <a href="http://www.thesixtyone.com/?referred_by_username=plamere">thesixtyone</a> includes me as a referrer - yes, I'll get thesixtyone points if you follow that link and register</i>

Anthony is part of the web 2.0 <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/28/the-hype-machine-releases-2007-music-blog-zeitgeist/">startup culture</a> so he certainly knows about geeks.  Here are some of Anthony's <a href="https://twitter.com/fascinated">tweets</a> during the conference:
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Haven't been so repeatedly and consistently outgeeked this way in a long time, ISMIR rocks!   <em>06:17 PM September 15, 2008  </em>
	
</li><li>ISMIR's geeks outgeek Web 2.0 NY geeks by a massive margin<em> 02:21 PM September 15, 2008 </em>
</li><li>ISMIR 2008 is hardcore-geeky, I love it! First talk is on relationship of geometry and musical consonance... !!! <em>06:16 AM September 15, 2008 </em>
</li></ul>
Anthony is a great guy to talk to - he's really smart, understands 
better than almost anyone what it takes to build a site that people will
 want to visit, and perhaps most important of all - he is extremely 
passionate about music - which is key to success in the music 2.0 world.
