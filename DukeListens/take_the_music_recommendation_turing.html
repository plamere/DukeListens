<p>I don't know which is which.</p>


<p>I think A is better if you like Miles' stuff up to about 1968, and B is better if you like his stuff from 1968 onwards.</p>


<p>Ok, OK, that's not a straight answer, but Miles' career is so 
extensive and wide-ranging that it's hard to pin down. I like the later 
stuff, so B is better for me.</p>

<p>This is where Artist-based recommendation gets tricky.  </p>


<p>I am a big Miles Davis fan (as I have a pulse) but everything from 
"On the Corner" and beyond gets too fusion-y/Funky for me.  I would say 
because I am a fan of Traditional Jazz, Bop and Cool, List A is the 
winner (minus Weather Report, thank you.  Somebody once said "There's a 
fine line between the music of Weather Report and the music on The 
Weather Channel" and I have always agreed.)</p>


<p>BUT: My buddies who are into Phish, Umphrey's Magee and and all 
things experimental/jammy would gravitate toward the Can/Sly &amp; the 
Family Stone/Tony Williams Lifetime/Dave Douglas list.</p>


<p>This is the double edged sword of the Artist recommendation: If I 
liked trad jazz and experimental jammy exploration, Miles Davis is right
 up my alley, but if I was just a fan of non-experimental stuff and 
heard Can into Sly into Weather Report as a representation of what Miles
 Davis is all about, I might get turned off of Miles for the rest of my 
life.</p>

<p>Tell us, Paul, were these two lists specifically chosen for the 
Turing test? Seems to me both list are valid (though I know little of 
Jazz), and each could be generated by either a critic or a machine. But 
if these were chosen by design, it's not really a turing test, it's 
rather a question of what we think a machine can do. More specifically, 
can the machine link Can and Sly to Miles Davis? (Though I think perhaps
 all turing tests can be transformed into similar questions: what can we
 expect the machine to do).</p>


<p>I'd pick the critic to be B, mostly because A is (to me) more 
conservative, and that being conservative is probably a good heuristic 
to maintain the quality of machine recommendations, to sort out the 
noise.</p>


<p>Now, I'm ready to bet that the critic would be much more likely to 
explain why he picked those 10 artists for recommendation, and that the 
machine would have much trouble doing so.</p>

<p>The recommendations in B remind me very much of the recommendations 
your system gave me for Le Volume Courbe. Both seem to come from the 
same recommendation system.</p>


<p>I wouldn't be surprised if the recommendations in list A were 
generated by a machine, too. It's really not hard to put together a list
 of similar artists for such popular artists.</p>


<p>So my guess is:</p>


<p>A = machine or human<br>
B = Paul's machine</p>

<p>Marco: - Good point about the human in the loop affecting the nature 
of the test.  I chose the two lists from a larger set of data.  I picked
 Miles Davis as the seed artist by hand since I wanted a fairly 
recognizable artist (not too many people know about 'deerhoof' now do 
they).  I chose the human list at  random from the set of human lists.  I
 chose one of our internal algorithms to represent the machines since no
 one else has the algorithm, and therefore can't check. If I chose 
last.fm or Mystrands or some other commercial recommender, some people 
would be able to recognize the results.</p>

<p>List A is machine, List B is human</p>


<p>List B picks out connected artists like Can and Sly Stone which could
 only be done by a human who knows the cultural history of the music and
 aware of the inter-connections and influences that have occured between
 different artists.  List B is more of a straight list of standard Jazz 
artists which has been generated because Miles is one of the key 
standard Jazz artists.  I think List B is better because it is more 
interesting and potentially takes you on a more rewarding journey.</p>

<p>@ Paul: this is great! :-)<br>
Maybe you should wait with your answer and give those attending your 
tutorial a chance to think about it, too? I'm very curious how your 
recommender works. The approaches I used for my own work (e.g. MusicSun)
 would have completely failed for artists like "Can".</p>


<p>@ Junior: You seem to know a lot more about music than I do, but have
 you tried a google search for "site:myspace.com miles davis sly family 
stone"? It really depends on what you tell the machine to do. For 
example, you could tell the machine to crawl MySpace profiles where 
people describe the music they like. </p>

<p>Good Work! Paul.  How about Human vs Algorithm vs "Community".  The 
"Community" being the tally of your most recent questionnare regarding 
how much is an artist like the seed artist.</p>


<p>Unless, of course, your algorithm is based on these questionnaires.  
Then in these two lists we are comparing a music expert vs the 
community/algorithm.  However, your algorithm may be looking at other 
factors such as genre, musical instruments used, period of time, mood.  
If you algorithm is working like the latter, then my suggestion of 
Expert vs Algorithm vs Community would be correct.</p>

<p>i'm gonna go with A being the better set. i agree that this is time 
period dependent, but while I can see Can being a good rec for late 
Davis fans, Sly seems like a bit of a stretch... </p>


<p>Here's a question: if I told you the person receiving the 
recommendations currently owned more than one album by Miles Davis, but 
*NOTHING* from list A, does that make list A a better or the worse list?</p>

<p>Yet another crazy angle: Since music from artists like Duke 
Ellington, Bill Evans (most music by) Sonny Rollins is more accessible 
or "listenable" than more Avant-Gardeish artists like Can or Dave 
Douglas, would the majority of people gravitate toward List A? </p>


<p>Despite the fact that List B may be more representative of the 
overall historical career of the artist, if people are hearing music 
they like in List A, has the system then made a better "Recommendation" 
(meaning suggesting music the person might like).</p>


<p>Is there any value in skewing the results toward more popular or 
widely "acceptable" songs? (I'm not advocating, just posing the 
question).</p>

<p>A is just a straightforward and obvious jazz list. <br>
B looks a bit more interesting since it throws in a joker or two.</p>


<p>It does not have to mean that A is machine generated and B generated

<p>If the idea is "let me listen to what I already like, because I only 
dig jazz" then I guess it will do. But wouldn't you already know all of 
the acts?</p>


<p>B for better. At least it lets you expand your horizon a bit. Which I think Miles was a bit about anyways ...</p>

<p>I think list A is probably the human. While both lists contain 
artists that a Miles Davis fan is statistically likely to enjoy, list A 
appears to have  been constructed with reference to some sort of notion 
of 'genre' (specifically, jazz, in this case),which is a pretty vague 
taxonomy, and therefore more likely to be the result of human influence.</p>

<p>I bet B is machine generated, although it's a tough one to call. I'm 
guessing the human expert would be more aware of genre boundaries, be 
they real or perceived.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>


<p>Here is my opinion:<br>
A = human<br>
B = machine<br>
but just because I think B is better so it should be your system :-)</p>


<p>thanks for your tutorial with oscar at Ismir.</p>

<p>Dear Paul,</p>


<p>awesome posting :)</p>


<p>A = a conservative human music expert (maybe using a community/cultural metadata system :) )<br>
B = an open-minded recommendation engine in a funky mood</p>


<p>PS I ordered already the give-away, so please excluded me from the selection process:)</p>

<p>I think B's oddities indicate a single person's bias, whereas A would be the average list I would see from a bunch of people.</p>

<p>I can't see that even a machine list listening to Miles Davis would 
include Tony Williams Lifetime, so I suspect that's the fabulosity of 
your algoritm, so I vote:<br>
A: Human<br>
B: Machine<br>
However, if it was some other recommendation system, I would probably 
have reversed it. I'm probably second and third guessing completely 
incorrectly.<br>
Mind you, it has made me dig out a Sly and the Family Stone album, so I would prefer B either way, just for the genre-merge.</p>

<p>B has differences that wouldn't show up in a human's list because a human will stick to the genre.</p>


<p>That said I think I like B more.</p>

<p>I know little jazz and nothing by the people listed but I could see 
(before reading the comments) that there was 50% overlap between the 
lists and this overlap occurred in the TOP HALF of list B.</p>


<p>That makes A probably someone's rambling mind and B the more googleicious.</p>
