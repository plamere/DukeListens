 This year's call contains changes from previous years that might affect
 your submission. &nbsp; In particular there is no tiered papers. All 
papers will be allotted up to the full six pages in the proceedings. 
Authors will be limited to three submissions (with only one submission 
as the first author).&nbsp; Perhaps most importantly, there will be a 
strong emphasis on interdisciplinary submissions - papers that span two 
or more disciplines will be given preference.<br>

systems.&nbsp;</p>

With the demise of WebJay and MusicMobs - we've been without a good 
playlist sharing site.&nbsp; And with some excellent playlist sharing 
opportunities with sites like <a href="https://spotify.com/">Spotify</a>,
 it seems that the time for playlist sharing is now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
To remedy this situation until a full-fledged playlist sharing site 
emerges, I've created a little Wiki for sharing playlists.&nbsp; The 
model couldn't be easier.&nbsp; Create a playlist (with Spotify, or some
 other music service), then post a link and a description to the 
wiki.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; Of course this won't scale more than a few 
dozen playlists, but it is a place to start.&nbsp; Check it out 
at:&nbsp; <a href="http://groupmix.wetpaint.com/">Group Mix</a></p><p>Update:&nbsp; Magnus points out that there is a site called <a href="http://www.spotlists.com/">Spotlists</a> for sharing Spotify playlists.&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I am lucky enough to be able to participate in the private beta of a next-generation music service called Spotify.&nbsp; As I <a href="woah_spotify_is_pretty_cool.html">described previously</a>,
 Spotify is the real celestial jukebox - it has a seemingly bottomless 
collection of music - by every artist that I can think of (and I can 
think of a lot).&nbsp; Today, the folks at Spotify released a new 
feature: <a href="http://blog.spotify.com/archives/2008/01/30/collaborative-playlists">Collaborative Playlists</a>.&nbsp;
 With Collaborative Playlists you can give your friends a playlist that 
they can not only listen to, they can add new tracks to, and any changes
 they make to the playlist you see (and hear) too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Need help
 making a mix for friday's party - get your friends to help.&nbsp; This 
is a pretty neat idea, and one that I've not seen before. What really 
makes this work is the fact that all Spotify users have access to the 
same huge music catalog - this makes sharing and collaborating on 
playlists not only possible, but dead simple.&nbsp; To add a song to the
 playlist, just right click on the song and click 'add to playlist'. No 
more digging through music collections to see what songs you have in 
common with your friends, no more searching the 'net to find the set of 
tracks that your friends are listening to.&nbsp; The music is all right 
there.<br> </p><p>Spotify's collaborative playlisting feature just 
highlights how, when we all have access to the celestial jukebox, there 
will be so many ways for people to do things with their music&nbsp; that
 has been hard to do so far. Collaborative playlisting&nbsp; is just the
 tip of the proverbial iceberg.</p><p>Still, the Spotify collaborative 
playlisting could perhaps be improved&nbsp; a bit.&nbsp; Right now, 
there doesn't seem to be any way for a playlist editor to add any 
description to the playlist. It'd be nice if when I create a 
collaborative playlist that I could&nbsp; include a bit of text that 
describes what the playlist is about - to give future editors a bit of 
guidance about what goes in the playlist.&nbsp; Similarly, when someone 
adds a song to a playlist they should be given the option to explain why
 they've added that song.</p><p>Right now, I suspect that the world of 
Spotify users is still rather small, so the opportunities for 
collaborating on playlists are small.&nbsp; But let me start a 
collaborative playlist to see what happens.&nbsp; For this playlist, 
find a song that is slightly more happy than the current last song on 
the playlist and add&nbsp; the song to the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll 
start with the very unhappy 'hurt' - as covered by Johnny Cash.&nbsp; 
Here's the playlist<a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/plamere/playlist/5UeYUj6jwyVwzLbt4Z5mac"> :Make Me Happy</a>.&nbsp;
 Have at it. (Oh, if you are not a Spotify user, but would like to play 
along, I'll post the contents of the playlist here periodically.&nbsp; 
If you have suggestions to add - just post a comment and I will add it.)<br></p><p><b>Update #1:&nbsp;</b> Four songs so far:</p><ul><li>Hurt - Johnny Cash</li><li>Rape Me - Mirvana</li><li>Miss Li - Miss Li</li><li>Brimful of Asha (Cornershop FBS Remix) - Fatboy Slim</li></ul><p>Remember
 - the goal is to make a playlist that will seemlessly pull us from the 
very depressing 'Hurt' - into happy or even giddy territory.&nbsp; Feel 
free to insert or reorder tracks as necessary</p><p><b>&nbsp;Update #2</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;
 20 songs and counting - we seem to be having no trouble finding the 
happy/giddy songs .. but the songs that cross the border on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_%28psychology%29">valence</a> scale seem to be missing.&nbsp; Current songs:</p><ol><li>Hurt&nbsp; - Johnny Cash</li><li>Ain't No Sunshine - Woven Hand</li><li>Rape Me - Nirvana</li><li>This Place is&nbsp; a prison - The Postal Service</li><li>Smile&nbsp; - Lily Allen</li><li>Miss Li - Miss Li</li><li>Run to the Hills - Hellsongs</li><li>Giddy Up! - The Hives</li><li>Brimful of Asha - Fatboy Slim</li><li>Tomoko - Hafdis Huld</li><li>Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss - Built to Spill</li><li>Dancing in the Moonligh - Toploader</li><li>Walking on Sunshine - Katrina and the waves</li><li>Duke's Travels - Genesis</li><li>Dashboard - Modest Mouse</li><li>Dancing in the Streets - Martha and the Vandellas</li><li>I just Can't get Enough - Nouvelle Vague</li><li>Shake Me Baby - Junior Senior</li><li>finally - Ce Ce Peniston</li><li>Beautiful Day - U2</li><li>I want you back - the jackson 5</li><li>I'm so excited - the pointer sisters</li><li>Always look on the bright side of life - Monty Python</li></ol>(Clearly we need some reordering here)<br><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.foxytunes.com/planet">Foxytunes planet</a> is
 music information aggregator.&nbsp; FoxyTunes Planet collects 
information from all sorts of web sources and displays them on a single

Last.fm, flickr, LyricWiki, HypeMachine, Youtube and lots more.&nbsp; 
You can customize your layout and add/remove various sources.&nbsp; </p><p>Foxytunes
 Planet tries hard to find the right info - but sometimes it misses the 
mark. Search for the band 'the the'&nbsp; and the flickr and youtube 
videos found are not related at all.&nbsp; Search for the band 'Blur' 
and the flickr images are ... well blurry.&nbsp; </p><p>Foxytunes Planet
 seems to play a bit fast and loose with other people's data - they 
don't restrict themselves to creative commons licensed photos from 
flickr for instance - lots of images shown are in the 'all rights 
reserved category'.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are also using data from sites like
 Last.Fm that have a&nbsp; policy of non-commercial use only.&nbsp; If 
FoxyTunes Planet is making money on Amazon or iTunes referrals then it

				<p>One of the highlights of <a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/nemisig/">NEMISIG</a> was the unveiling of the new <a href="http://analyze.echonest.com/AudioAnalysis.html">EchoNest music analysis web service</a>.&nbsp;
 You give the web service an&nbsp; MP3 file, and it returns a big wad of
 XML filled with all sorts of interesting things that can be derived 
from the music. For instance, if you wanted to fill out that 
Beats-per-minute field for each track in iTunes, you could upload your 
tracks to the web service and extract the &lt;tempo&gt; field from the 
returned XML. This is a pretty cool thing, and a great idea.&nbsp; (And a
 great way for the EchoNest to collect lots of data (not that they need 
it)).<br> </p><p>This is one of the first things we've seen&nbsp; to come out of the nest - I can't wait to see what comes out next.&nbsp;</p>

				Karla Starr as an excellent piece in the Seattle Weekly called: <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/2008-01-23/music/22-000-songs-and-nothing-to-listen-to.php">22,000 Songs and Nothing to Listen To</a>.&nbsp;
 Karla tries to figure what impact having so many music choices will 
have.&nbsp; She's done her leg work - lots of commentary by people who 
think about this stuff a lot. Here's a choice quote by Dan 
Levitin:&nbsp; "the average 14-year-old can hear more
music in a month than someone would have heard in an entire lifetime
just 300 years ago"

				<p>Last.fm has been getting a whole lotta love about yesterday's 
announcement that they would offer free on-demand music 
streaming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Commenters on RJ's blog post seemed <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2008/01/23/free-the-music">downright giddy</a>.&nbsp; Multiple <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2008/01/23/free-the-music">Digg</a> front page stories, the<a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=last.fm&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;scoring=d&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=d"> blog-o-sphere all a twitter</a>.&nbsp; People seem genuinely excited about free on-demand tracks at Last.fm. &nbsp;</p><p>Which
 may seem to be a bit puzzling.&nbsp; Napster has offered the exact same
 free, web-based, on-demand music listening.&nbsp; From the<a href="http://www.napster.com/faq/"> Napster FAQ</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>  You can search our catalog of 3 million songs and stream songs up to 3 times each for FREE.
		After the 3rd free play of any single track,
		you can either purchase the track or become a Napster subscriber.  As a subscriber, you can
		download an unlimited number of full-length songs to your PC.  As a <i>Napster To Go</i> subscriber
		you can transfer those tracks to your compatible portable player without paying per track</i>.&nbsp;
		</p><p>Compare that to the Last.fm announcement: <i>Each track can be played up to 3 times for free before a notice appears
telling you about our upcoming subscription service. The soon-to-be
announced subscription service will give you unlimited plays and some
other useful things.</i></p><p>&nbsp;It's the same deal.&nbsp; So why 
are we so excited about Last.fm offering something that has been 
available for years? For me the difference is clear.&nbsp; Last.fm is 
all about music discovery.&nbsp; They have many (perhaps too many!) ways
 to help me find new music.&nbsp; They have the traditional charts that 
show me what is popular.&nbsp; They recommend music based upon my 
listening behavior (I don't have to manually rate tracks). They do 
clever things with the massive amounts of social tags they've 
collected.&nbsp; They will let me explore my friends listening to help 
me find new music.&nbsp; They make lots of their data available so 
others can try to build new things around the Last.fm listening 
experience.</p><p>To me, Last.fm is like a big music club,&nbsp; where 
there are lots of people who are really interested in music, and where 
there are lots of toys to play with.&nbsp; And now this music club is 
giving us a new toy .... on-demand music.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Napster, on 
the other hand, is like a big hardware store.&nbsp; They probably have 
all of the stuff that I'm looking for, but it is probably not a place 
that I'd want to hang out.&nbsp; </p><p>Music pundits have been 
proclaiming that music subscription services are dead - but I think they
 are wrong.&nbsp; It is just that these subscription services can't keep
 their subscribers because they don't know how to keep the subscribers 
happy.&nbsp; You can't just throw 3 million songs onto the net and leave
 your subscribers to find the music.&nbsp; If you want to keep your 
subscribers, you've got to keep them happy - and the way to do that is 
to surround your millions of tracks with ways to help people explore all
 that music.&nbsp; Last.fm knows how to do this.&nbsp; That's why I am 
excited about Last.fm.<br></p>

				<p>Just last week, I <a href="the_celestial_jukebox_is_here.html">predicted that 2008 would be the year of free music</a>.&nbsp; I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>In 2008, this is all going to change.&nbsp; We are now starting to see the
next generation of music apps hit the web that no longer are beholden
to the rules of Internet radio. These&nbsp; music apps allow you to play any
song you want, at anytime for free. 2008 will be the year of the Celestial Jukebox - at least if you are
sitting at your computer, You will be able to listen to virtually any
song that you want, on demand.&nbsp; The only time you will need to pay for
music is if you want to listen to it on your iPod or your living room
stereo.</p></blockquote><p>Today, Last.fm has rolled out their on-demand service.&nbsp; RJ describes this in<a href="http://blog.last.fm/2008/01/23/free-the-music"> his blog </a>(my emphasis added):<br></p><blockquote><p>Full-length tracks are now available in the US, UK, and Germany, and
we’re hard at work broadening our coverage into other countries. During
this initial public beta period, each track can be played up to 3 times
for free before a notice appears telling you about our <i>upcoming
subscription</i> service. The soon-to-be announced subscription service
will give you unlimited plays and some other useful things. We’re also
working on bringing full-length tracks to the desktop client and <i>beyond</i>.</p></blockquote><p>This
 is a big deal. Big for last.fm and big for music listeners.&nbsp; Free 
on-demand listening, coupled with last.fm's huge social data and 
listener-base will let last.fm and its listeners do all sorts of 
interesting things.&nbsp; Last.fm is also opening the door for new 
artists,&nbsp; letting them upload
music and earning money each time their songs are played on 
last.fm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Last.fm's offering is not 100% free 
though.&nbsp; It is like Napster's offering - 3 free plays (Napster 
offered 5) of any particular song.&nbsp; After the 3rd play you need to 
be a subscriber&nbsp; before you can listen again to that song.&nbsp; 
This model works for music discovery and really helps making playlists 
shareable - but it won't replace your iTunes music collection.&nbsp; If 
you really like a song, you'll have to buy it or become a 
subscriber.&nbsp; I'm interested to see how a last.fm subscription 
service will work - any subscription service that doesn't work&nbsp; 
with the iPod is going to have a tough time .&nbsp;  (Some details on 
the last.fm unlimited listening subscription <a href="https://www.last.fm/subscribe">are here</a>).<br> </p><p>I'm
 excited to see where last.fm goes with this. They have lots of smart 
people who are working hard to turn last.fm into the celestial box. 
Last.fm really will become the last fm radio station you'll ever need. 
2008 is the year of free music on the desktop ... 2009 will be the year 
of free music everywhere.&nbsp; The celestial jukebox is here!<br></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Next week I am going to visit the University of Montreal to give a talk at Professor Eck's '<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Epift6080/en/index.html">Music and Machine Learning</a>'
 course.&nbsp; Doug asked me to suggest a paper or two to serve as 
background reading.&nbsp; Instead, I'll describe the prerequisites right
 here in this blog entry.</p><p>I'm going to talk about music discovery 
and recommendation.&nbsp; Since the course is about music and machine 
learning, naturally I'll talk about how we can use some of the automated
 techniques such as music classification and music similarity to improve
 recommendations. But before we get there I want to put the machine 
learning bits into a larger framework of music recommendation and 
discovery.&nbsp; To fill out some of this background and to get you 
thinking about music recommendation,&nbsp; you have two pre-class 
assignments:</p><p>The first assignment is to visit and use the following music recommendation/discovery sites:<br> </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.last.fm/dashboard/">Last.fm</a> <br>
  </li><li><a href="https://www.pandora.com/">Pandora </a><a href="http://ilike.com/"></a></li><li><a href="http://ilike.com/">iLike.com</a> <br></li><li><a href="http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/">Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music</a><br></li><li><a href="http://www.musicovery.com/">Musicovery</a><br>
  </li><li><a href="http://www.owlmusicsearch.com/">Owl Music search<br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes</a> <br></li><li><a href="https://hypem.com/">Hype Machine</a> <br></li><li><a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a></li></ul><p align="center">(<i>Update</i>: Note that Pandora might not work in Canada, <a href="http://globalpandora.com/">GlobalPandora</a> might work, but then again it might not) <br></p><p>For each site think about:</p><ul><li>What technique does the site use to help you discover music?</li><li>How far into <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/">the long tail</a> does the site get you?</li><li>How deep is the catalog of music?</li><li>How central is music recommendation and discovery to the site?</li></ul><p>The
 second assignment is to post a comment to this blog entry that 
describes how you made your most recent music discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I'll post the description of my most recent discovery to kick things 
off.<br></p><p>(note, if you are not taking the class, but just happen 
to be reading this blog, you don't have to do the homework, but you can 
if you want).</p><p>Update:&nbsp; I've <a href="http://mediacast.sun.com/users/lamere/media/music_recommendation_is_broken">posted the slides for the talk.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
