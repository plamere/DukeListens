			<h2>My worst ISMIR moment</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://ismir2007.ismir.net/">ISMIR</a>, the annual Music
 Information Retrieval conference is just a week away.&nbsp; I'm really 
looking forward to it.&nbsp; It is always a great learning experience, a
 super opportunity to meet lots of energetic, and very smart people that
 are passionate about music.&nbsp; This year I'll be busy too. I'm 
presenting with Oscar a&nbsp; <a href="http://ismir2007.ismir.net/tutorials.html#tut2">music recommendation tutorial</a>,
 two poster sessions (Thierry is doing all the hard work on one of 
them), and I am a chair for the session on recommendation.&nbsp; This 
will be only my second time acting as a session chair.&nbsp; At last 
year's ISMIR I learned about what my duties are as a session 
chair.&nbsp; There are really just two things: make sure that the 
speakers end on time, and make sure that during the Q&amp;A after a talk
 that if no one else asks a question that you ask one. Apparently, every
 speaker needs at least one question to feel fulfilled as a 
speaker.&nbsp; Easy enough, end on time and ask a question if needed.<br><br>It
 was in my role as session chair that I had my worst ISMIR moment.&nbsp;
 I was doing fine making sure that the speakers ended on time (even when
 we had to swap speakers around when one chap couldn't get his slides to
 appear on the projector).&nbsp; However there was one speaker who gave a
 talk about a topic that I just didn't understand. I didn't grasp the 
goal of the research,&nbsp; the methods, the conclusions or the 
applicability of the research.&nbsp; All the way through the talk I was 
wracking my brains trying to eek out an appropriate, salient question 
about the research. A question that wouldn't mark me as the idiot that I
 clearly was. By the end of the talk I was regretting my decision to 
accept the position as session chair.&nbsp; I could only pray that 
someone else would ask the required question and save me from 
humiliating myself and insulting the speaker.&nbsp; The speaker 
concluded the talk,&nbsp; I stood up and thanked the speaker, offered a 
silent prayer to the God of Curiosity and then asked the assembled for 
questions. Silence.&nbsp; Long Silence. Really long silence. My worst 
nightmare. I was going to ask a question, but by this point I couldn't 
even remember what the talk was about. It was going to be a bad 
question, something like "Why do you find this topic interesting?" or 
"Isn't Victoria nice?".&nbsp; Just microseconds before I uttered my 
feeble query, a hand went up,&nbsp; I was saved. Someone asked a 
question.&nbsp; I don't remember the question, I just remember the 
relief. My job as session chair was complete, every speaker had their 
question.</p><p>&nbsp;This year, I think I'll be a bit more comfortable 
as a session chair.&nbsp; I know the topic of the session quite well 
(recommendation), and I know the speakers too, but still, please don't 
be offended if I ask you "why do you find this topic interesting?"<br></p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LOL :-)<br>
I remember that! </p>


<p>Yes, those questions at the end of the talk are extremely important. 
One of the first things I usually ask colleagues when they have given a 
talk at a conference is if they got interesting questions. I think if 
I'd ever (which might never happen) end up in such a situation I'd try 
one of the following to end the awkward silence:</p>


<p>- Let the author go over the time limit, and then explain that 
unfortunately there is no more time for questions, and tell the audience
 that the speaker will be available in the coffee break fur further 
discussions.</p>


<p>- Pick up a random item from the "future work" slide (which hopefully
 is still being displayed) and ask how exactly that would work.</p>


<p>- Ask about the computational complexity. </p>


<p>- I believe I once heard a session chair end the silence at the end 
of the last talk of his session with something like "It seems everyone 
is already thinking of the lunch buffet, so lets end this session, and 
thank our speaker for this very interesting talk one more time."</p>
