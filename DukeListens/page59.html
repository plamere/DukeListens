				<p>

So lets talk about ISMIR. This year's ISMIR is being hosted by Queen
Mary University of London and Goldsmiths College, University of London.
This year ISMIR has some corporate sponsors including Microsoft research,
Hewlett Packard, Philips Research,  and Sun Microsystems.  ISMIR is
starting to be recognized in the industrial/commercial world as an
important conference in today's world of digital music. (It has
already been recognized as such in the academic world).
</p><p>
About 230 people are attending ISMIR this year, representing 25
countries.  The proceedings are over 700 pages long (and add to the
amount of exercise I've been getting as I lug this precious volume up
and down the streets of London).
</p><p>
One of the themes of this year's ISMIR seems to be <i>Let's hook up
the music technologists with the musicologists</i> Indeed, these two
groups, musicologists and technologist have not really collaborated
too much in the MIR community which causes endless difficulties and
duplication of effort. For instance, recently on the MUSIC-IR mailing
list, there's been a debate about the usefulness of music
genre classification (and the use of genre in general).  It was
pointed out (several times) today that it would be wise (and a heck of a lot
easier) to just ask the musicologists how to deal with genre and all the
problems it is causing since musicologists have experience
answering just this this sort of question.  This theme of improved
communication and cooperation were outlined in the
opening talk by Nicholas Cook, a Research Professor of Music, at Royal
Holloway, University of London. Professor Cook warned  that
although computers have been a useful tools by musicologists for quite
sometime, it is important to remember that the listening experience is
an essential part of music analysis, and that with 'computer
musicology' we are in danger of losing that.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/1_002.jpg">
</p><p>
One of my favorite talks of the day was by <b>Jin Ha Lee</b> from the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She talked about a very
interesting problem that I didn't even know existed.  Imagine hearing
music from another culture. If you really like the music, you might
want to hear more of the music, or you may want to learn more about
the artist or the genre of this new music. Jin Ha points out that
since all of our music search tools are text based we have no real way
of forming queries for this music.  We may not understand the lyrics,
we certainly don't recognize the genre, we don't recognize the artist,
we may not even understand the mood (since the mood of a song is often
conveyed in the lyrics). Jin Ha suggests that for cross
cultural/multilingual music information seeking, the best approaches
for music search may be non-language queries such as query by example,
query based upon music similarity, culturally neutral labels.
</p><p>
<b>Gerhard Widmer</b> from Johannes Kepler University described some
interesting work involving data mining the web for co-occurrence of artists using
a technique similar to Google's pagerank for discovering 'prototypical
artists', that is, those that are the best representative for their
particular genre. Some of the difficulties with mining the web are
dealing with bands that have names that are also common words. Bands
such as Queen, Kiss and Yes get skewed statistics because of their
common names.  I didn't dare ask how they'd deal with the band "the
the".
</p><p> <b>Ian Knopke</b> of McGill presented some early work in the geospatial
location of music and sound files.  Ian has a web crawler designed to
find music and then uses a number of techniques to discover where
physically the data is located.
</p><p>
<b>Thomas Lidy</b> presented some excellent research on how to evaluate
feature extractors and psychoacoustic transformations for music genre
classification. Thomas was able to show how their rhythm histogram led
to genre classification accuracy improvements.  I wonder about some of
the testing methodology though. I think some of the test data sets
were too small, or Thomas's classifier was over-fitting because there
was some unexplained large difference in accuracy across different
data sets.  This highlights one of the trouble spots for audio
classification ... there just isn't enough data for testing and
training systems. The copyright problems make it very hard to get an
adequate sized, labelled collection that researchers can share.
</p><p>
<b>Cory McKay</b> of McGill described the framework for optimizing music
classification that they've been building. Cory and others have been
building ACE, the Autonomous Classification Engine.  Given a set of
features, ACE will try a number of classifiers, tuning parameters,
classifier ensembles and other techniques to try to optimize the
classification.  ACE is written in Java and is released  (or will be
soon) under the GPL. ACE looks really interesting. It will be a great
tool for anyone trying to improve music classification algorithms. I
expect that ACE will help raise the bar in a number of classification
tasks at next years MIREX.  The McGill team is also releasing several
other open source Java-based packages for use by MIR developers.
With these contributions, McGill is really adding value to the MIR community.
Go McGill!

</p><p>
<b>Audo to Score</b>There were a number of talks in the 'audio to score' track describing
techniques for extracting pitch, onset, and harmonic content directly
from audio.  These are probably some of the most mathematically
intensive talks of the conference, .. the math was flowing .. at one
point a slide was shown with probably 10 separate formula, with the
speaker comment of "and then some math occurs and then ...".  Two
separate papers presented by students from the University of Tokyo
involved pitch extraction.  There was an interesting audio demo of
converting an audio stream to MIDI data. These system were able to
deal with harmonies generated by piano and guitar quite well.
</p><p>
</p><h3> Monday Posters </h3>
During lunch time we were able to review a number of posters while we
munched on our sandwiches and finger food.  There were just too many
posters for me to get a chance to talk to all of the presenters, but I
did talk to a few folks. Some highlights:
<ul>
<li>  <b> Playsom</b> Robert Neumayer was demonstrating his PlaySom
system. PlaySom is a user interface that allows the user to browse a
large music collection by navigating a map of clustered music tracks.
This approach provides a potentially better way to find and build
playlists on small devices.
</li><li> <b> Sonixplorer</b> A system that uses visualization and
auralization for content-based music exploration of music collections.
Dominik Lubbers showed a clustering system where aural browsing of
music collections were possible.
</li><li> <b><a href="http://foafing-the-music.iua.upf.edu/"> Foafing the Music</a></b> This system uses 'friend of a friend'
and RSS for recommending music depending on the users personal tastes.
This system, developed by folks at Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona Spain
mines data from RSS feeeds including Audioscrobbler as well as based
upon the content of the music (i.e. content-based music similarity).
</li><li> <b>Rebecca Fiebrink</b> was describing her work on using genetic
algorithms for determine feature weighting for music classification.  You can try it out
<a href="http://mtg100.upf.es/foafing-the-music/index.html"> at their website.</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
The day ended at about 6:30.  I ended up joining a group going out to
dinner in an East London Indian Restaurant.  Jeremy Pickens was kind
enough to shepard the six of us through the tube and to the
restaurant.  The food was excellent, and plentiful (and extremely
inexpensive for London).
<br>
<img src="support_files/1.jpg">
<br>
  And finally the day was capped off with a
Jazz/rap concert by Soweto Kinch in Spitalfields.
<img src="support_files/1_003.jpg">
</p><p> You don't hear music like that in New Hampshire.
</p><p>
All in all it was a great day. And now ... off to bed ...

Well, I made it to London in one piece. Funny thing was that the last 15
 miles from the airport to the hotel took almost as long as the first 
3000 miles.  Getting through the passport line was the hardest of all.  
1.5 hours of standing in line after a long flight, blah.  But, after a 
good night sleep (in the smallest hotel room in the world) I took a good
 tour around london.  Here's a nice shot from the top of the <a href="https://www.londoneye.com/">London Eye</a>
</p><p>

</p><p>
After my walk around town, I connected up with a few folks and went to 
find the conference venue, register and get the conference packet.  The 
packet included a printed copy of the proceedings (W00T) which will give
 me many hours of reading pleasure. One of the neat things about ISMIR 
is that all of the papers are published on-line shortly after the 
conference.  For instance, you can find all of the 2004 papers <a href="http://www.iua.upf.es/mtg/ismir2004/review/ProgramSessions?type=topic">here.</a>
</p><p> 
Tomorrow things start in earnest... looking forward to some MIR fun.

In just a few minutes, I'll be heading out the door to catch a plane.  I'm heading to London where I'll be attending <a href="http://ismir2005.ismir.net/">ISMIR - The International Conference on Music Information Retrieval </a>.
  ISMIR is the primary venue for MIR researchers and practitioners.  
This will be my first trip to ISMIR and I'm looking forward to meeting 
many of the folks that I know of through emails, papers and journal 
articles.  I'm anticipating a great week of learning, talking and 
getting to know people.  Plus, after the conference I'll have over a 
hundred new <a href="http://ismir2005.ismir.net/papers.html"> papers</a> to read and digest. Lots of fun.

In the last few months, we've been working hard trying to improve our
algorithms for determining acoustic and perceptual similarity of
music.  One aspect of this is task is to chose a good set of features
to extract from music.  We've done a number of experiments with
various feature sets to help us understand what feature sets work best
for various tasks.

</p><p></p><p>
One major difficulty with these types of experiments is that feature
extraction can be extremely CPU intensive.  Lots of time consuming DSP
algorithms (MP3, decoding, FFTs, filtering, windowing, convolutions,
DCTs) are used during feature extraction.  A fast feature extractor can
run in 0.1 X Realtime, that is, it can process ten seconds of audio
in one second.  That seems pretty fast, but it still takes nearly
<b>three days</b> to process our modest sized test collection of 10,000
songs.  And we don't just want to extract one feature set, we want to
extract and experiment with twenty different kinds of feature sets.
Plus, sooner or later we are going to want to scale this up to
industrial sized music collections.  Extracting a single feature set
for 2,000,000 songs could take <b>18 months</b> of continuous
processing.
</p><p></p><p>

Luckily, I work for a company like Sun, that has some pretty good
computing resources.  Sun is rolling out its
<a href="http://www.sun.com/service/sungrid/index.html">Sun Grid
</a>, the $1/cpu-hr compute utility. With the grid, I should be able
to take my feature extractor and distribute it over a collection of
hundreds of CPUs to yield a 100X performance.  My 3 day feature
extractor will run in 45 minutes.  The 18 month processing of
2,000,000 songs will take less than a week.  This has the potential to really
change how I work.  I'll be able to try all sorts of experiments that
would just take too long otherwise.

</p><p></p><p>
I'm really excited about this. With the grid, I'll be able to do all
sorts of things that would otherwise be nearly impossible.

Rumors are that Microsoft is planning to deploy a <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-5739458.html">music subscription service</a> similar to the one recently unveiled by <a href="https://music.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>.
  The interesting thing of course is that all of the music subscription 
services that allow you to take your rented music on the road in a 
portable music player rely on Microsoft's <a href="http://www.playsforsure.com/">Play For Sure</a>
 technology.  So Microsoft will have to figure out how to offer a music

time.  Hmmm ... it would be nice if there were some alternative portable
 DRM solutions out there ...

I just hooked up a <a href="http://www.sun.com/sunray/sunray1/index.xml">Sun Ray</a>
 in my home office.  It was surprisingly easy to setup, just connect the
 supplied VPN router to the home router, connect the Sun Ray to the

of the big surprises:
</p><ul>
<li> I have a 1920x1600 flatpanel monitor.  The Sun Ray was able to recognize and drive the display at its full resolution.  
</li><li> The Sun Ray is very responsive. Editing, browsing, mouse 
clicking ... all work just as well as when I am working at the office. 
</li></ul>
<p>
So far, I'm very happy with the Sun Ray ... it saves me lots of time.  I
 don't have to fool around with long VPN passwords, and my work session 
travels with me when I go from home to work and back home again.  I just
 plug my badge into the Sun Ray wherever I am an my session appears.

It just keeps on raining; pouring from the sky.

<i>It just keeps on raining, watching life go by.

<i>You can feel offended that it rains on your birthday party but the rain doesn’t care – it just keeps on raining.
</i></p><p>
<i>But it just keeps on raining and I just keep complaining And I really wouldn't
blame you If you didn't want me for your friend.
</i></p><p>
<i>I feel like this cloud of depression is floating over me and it just keeps on
raining. 
</i></p><p>
<i>Man, it just keeps on raining. Which makes me lazier. I have a busy work
schedule leading up to Jamaica which means the hole I'm digging won't be as bad.
</i></p><p>
<i>"But the weather is terrible, as it just keeps on raining!" protests virtually
all of my friends. In contrast, I am hoping it would rain, ...
</i></p><p>
<i>It just keeps on raining here. Everyday it rains. All weekend it rained.
Each day I got up early, ran though the rain to the garage, and got in my car.
</i></p><p>
<i>It's so good to see that after the drought we've been living with for
 many years.  Now I hope it just keeps on raining this summer.

This recent article on slashdot called <a href="https://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/23/2229255&amp;tid=141&amp;tid=126">New Phone Service Promises to ID Songs</a> talks about a phone-based service called  <a href="http://www.411song.com/">411-SONG</a>. There's nothing new here,  audio fingerprinting systems such as  <a href="https://www.shazam.com/uk/do/home">Shazam</a>, <a href="http://www.relatable.com/">Relatable</a> and <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> have been doing this for a while.
</p><p>
The paper <a href="http://ismir2002.ismir.net/proceedings/02-FP04-2.pdf">A Highly Robust Audio Fingerprinting System</a> gives a good description how an audio fingerprinting system works. <i>Update: fixed the broken PDF link</i>
