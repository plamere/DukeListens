			<h2>Building a better recommender - Not all opinions are created equal</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Most music recommendations are based on collaborative filtering 
algorithms.&nbsp; Sites like last.fm, goombah, qloud and iLike use the 
'wisdom of the crowds' to find related artists or songs. &nbsp; Using 
these techniques yield pretty good recommendations, but they could be 
better.&nbsp; For instance, in a collaborative filtering system, the 
opinion of a highly-engaged music listener, the 'super-fan' if you will,
 counts the same as the casual or indifferent listener.&nbsp; A CF 
system can't tell the difference between a Pitchfork music critic, 
listening to the latest Deerhoof album over and over so they can write 
the review, and a jogger that listens to the latest Deerhoof album over 
and over because it is good music for running.&nbsp; A music recommender
 should recognize that not all opinions are created equal, that some 
people really do know better than others. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>One attempt at focusing on taste makers is the site <a href="http://www.whenkilledlikeroosters.com/">When Killed Like Roosters</a>.&nbsp;
 WKLR is a music recommendation site that, unlike a traditional social 
recommender, will give extra weight to the opinions of the 
highly-engaged music listener.&nbsp; WKLR mines the taste data of music 
bloggers, those that care enough about music to write about it - and 
provides <a href="http://www.whenkilledlikeroosters.com/albums/">charts</a>
 of the most highly rated music based upon these tastemaker 
ratings.&nbsp;&nbsp; WKLR seems to have gone quiet over the last few 
months - so this is not an idea that is taking over the world by storm. 
Still, I think we will be seeing more CF systems that try to find the 
taste makers and the trend setters and give the opinions of these 
individuals more weight.<br></p>

                Interesting stuff, Paul, have you seen Peter Gabriel's 
latest pet project, which is also encouraging tastemakers

                That's interesting, Paul.  Certainly some reputation 
aspects should be taken into account in recommender systems, if only to 
eliminate bogus ratings by spammers.

But, I wonder whether giving taste makers more weight will necessarily 
improve the recommendations.  I would think that, for the most accurate 
predictions, you would want recommendation to come from people with 
similar tastes, not necessarily from people who do a lot of reviewing.

You know, there is a fairly good testbed now available for working on 
this kind of idea.  You could take the Netflix contest data and 
determine if weighting certain types of raters more highly resulted in 
substantial improvements in predictive accuracy.

                What could happen if you just rely on artist-band 
relationships, like common performances on discs, bands, songs, etc?
There was a Google SoC assignment where MusicBrainz, in order to 
populate it's artist-artist relation table wanted some queries to it's 
database dad did that.
http://musictrails.com.ar uses the MusicBrainz database in order to make
 an Erdos number of artists, creating a path of as many degrees as you 
want by common performances on discs, bands, songs, cover songs, etc.

I did something very similar with the musicbrainz data called 'six 
degrees of black sabbath'.  It was pretty fun to use.  I should release 
it sometime.  The musictrails site looks fun. - Paul

                Greg:

I agree with you in general, that the best recommendations come from 
people with similar tastes, however, given the results of some of the 
latest studies around popularity feedback (I'm thinking of the Duncan 
Watt's study at Columbia in particular), we see that social recommenders
 are particularly vulnerable to 'sheep effects', where the early 
opinions get amplified by the susceptible masses.  There are a large 
number of indifferent music consumers who will just listen to what 
everyone else is listening to. I'm sure you could find this same pattern
 in books and movies as well - there are some people who just read what 
is on the NYT best-seller list.  To me, it just doesn't make too much 
sense to treat the  tastes of these indifferents (Steve calls them 
'sheeple') with the same weight as the highly engaged.   Indeed, the 
answer lies in some of the large datasets like the netprize data or in 
the last.fm data.  - Paul
