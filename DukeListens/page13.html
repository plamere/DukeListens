				Recently, Michael Mandel updated the <a href="http://majorminer.com/info/intro">MajorMinor</a>
 site (an ESP-style game for collecting social tags for music), to allow
 one to browse the tags generated by humans as well as to examine the 
tags generated by their autotagging algorithms.  The machine tags are 
trained on the human tags to 'automatically find relevant clips based on
 their sounds'.  They have about 50 or so tags trained, including tags 
like 80s, instrumental, indie metal, strings, slow fast, repetitive, 
sample and rap. 
<p></p>
Some of the machine tags are really good:  <a href="http://majorminer.com/search/machine/jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="http://majorminer.com/search/machine/drum%20and%20bass">drum and bass</a> and <a href="http://majorminer.com/search/machine/female">female</a>. 
while some are not so good: <a href="http://majorminer.com/search/machine/violin">violin</a>, <a href="http://majorminer.com/search/machine/punk">punk</a> and <a href="http://majorminer.com/search/machine/keyboard">keyboard</a>.
<p>
It's great that Michael is making this data available for everyone to 
see and explore.  We have some similar data from our autotagger. <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eeckdoug/">Doug</a>
 has put together a nifty web for exploring this data - hopefully in the
 next couple of months we can do the same as Michael and make it 
available for all to use and explore.  Doug keeps threatening to start a
 blog, so perhaps he'll write about it sometime in the near future.

 This is one of my favorite freakomendations.  iTunes suggests that if 
you like "Baby One More Time" by Britney Spears, you might like the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Report_of_Pre-war_Intelligence_on_Iraq">Report on Pre-War Intelligence on Iraq</a>".  <p></p>This
 recommendation just doesn't seem to make any sense in any context.  
iTunes has lots of users so presumably they have lots of data and 
Britney Spears is a very popular artist - so this can't be a cold start 
problem. Something went awry somewhere. <p></p>Or perhaps there's some reason - there is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt8uNG02ixA">Britney Spears / Bob Dole connection</a> - or maybe the lyrics are some sort of subtle commentary on America's attitude toward Iraq. Hit me baby one more time indeed.

	<div class="entry-content">
				A couple of weeks ago, I made up the word '<a href="category-freakomendations-page0.html">freakomendations</a>'
 as a way to describe strange recommendations that are often made by 
recommender systems.  When I first used the word, I did a Google search 
and found that there were exactly zero usages of the word on the 
internet. This really was a new word according to Google.  
<p></p>
Now, two weeks later,  Google tells me that there are about <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=freakomendations">1,800 instances</a>
 of 'freakomendations' on the web.  Now since I've used the word in 
exactly 10 blog posts, that means that there are a whole lot of other 
people using the word now. Or does it?  I took a detailed look through 
the Google results and this is what I found.
<p></p>
Of the 1,780 results, Google thinks that only 72 of them are worth 
presenting, the rest are duplicates. Of these 72, only one mention is 
from another actual <a href="https://netflixfan.blogspot.com/2008/04/freakomendations.html">blog post</a>.
 All of the rest are aggregators of one type or another, that are just 
republishing my words on another feed. There are feeds that are devoted 
to serving up any post that mentions '<a href="http://www.topix.com/who/emerson-lake-palmer/">Emerson, Lake and Palmer</a>' for example.
<p>
</p> In about two weeks, each of my 10 freakomendation posts  seems to 
have spawned more than  100 copies in the various aggregators, 
republishers and splogs.  This propagation will likely continue.  This 
suggests that 99% of the RSS feeds out there are just re-broadcasting 
content. Only 1% of content is original. This makes me want to cry.

				<strong>If you like Norah Jones ...
You might like Ravi Shankar.</strong>

<p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Come-Away-Me-Norah-Jones/dp/B00005YW4H"><img src="support_files/411XEC9SEYL.jpg"></a>

</p><p>
At first blush, this looks like a bad recommendation - the Starbucks 
queen seems quite removed from the Indian Master - it is hard to imagine
 any kind of connection between these two artists, but the connection is
 actually quite close.  Ravi Shankar is the father of Norah Jones.  This
 little tidbit - the paternity of Norah Jones - turns what seems to be a
 bad recommendation into a credible recommendation.  
</p><p>
Often we get recommendations like this - where they seem to make no 
sense, but with a little information the recommendations can become 
good, or at least reasonable.
</p><p>
Recently last.fm added a 'connections' tab to the set of artist tabs, so
 now it is easier to find these types of musical connections.

 fun.  The game is well polished, easy to learn and potentially 
addictive to play.  My current high score is 6800.  Check it out.

				There's a fascinating and informative slide deck from Nielsen SoundScan called the <a href="http://www.narm.com/2008Conv/StateoftheIndustry.pdf">State of the Industry</a> that was presented at <a href="http://www.narm.com/esam/AM/Template.cfm?section=Home7">NARM</a> last week. Some highlights:
<blockquote><p></p>
Music is really long tail - in 2007,  450,344 of the 570,000 albums sold
 were purchased less than 100 times. 1,000 albums accounted for 50% of 
all album sales.
<p></p>
The music industry had its biggest sales week since they started keeping
 records, with 58 million units sold in the last week of 2007.  The 
previous record was 47 million during the last week of 2006.
<p></p>
13% of all album sales come from American Idol and the Disney franchises.
<p>
</p>
CD sales are down 31% since 2004, but digital music sales are up 490%.
<p></p>
Surprisingly, Vinyl sales are coming back - they grew 15% in 2007 and 
are up 70% in the first 3 months of this year. Mostly in indie vinyl.
<p></p>
1 out of 4 albums are purchased in a non-traditional retail store (i.e. internet, or at a concert).
<p></p>
80,000 albums were released in 2007
<p></p>
844 million digital tracks sold in 2007, 1% of all digital tracks accounted for 80% of all track sales.</blockquote>
There's lots more data in there. Definitely worth a good look.  - <em>Thanks Oscar</em>

				The Echo Nest has released their <a href="http://the.echonest.com/recommend/">new recommendation API</a>.
  The API will give you recommendations based upon a single artist or a 
set of recommended artists.  Echo Nest is one of the few commercial 
recommenders that doesn't rely on collaborative filtering for 
recommendations.  Instead, the Echo Nest combines information from 
"online cultural data, text analysis, audio analysis and user activity".

The API is very easy to use.  You make queries like this to lookup 
artist IDs:

<pre>http://api.echonest.com/lookup?api_key=MY_KEY&amp;names=the+beatles
</pre>
Once you get an artist ID you can get recommendations with this request:

<pre>http://api.echonest.com/recommendations?api_key=MY_KEY&amp;ids=AR6XZ861187FB4CECD
</pre>

Some recommendations using the new Echo Nest Recommendation API

Seed Artist of Jimi Hendrix:

<ul>
<li>Cream,
</li>
<li>HendriX
</li>
<li>Stevie Ray Vaughan
</li>
<li>Jeff Beck
</li>
<li>The Jimi Hendrix Experience
</li><li>Eric Clapton
</li>
<li>Funkadelic
</li>
<li>Buddy Miles
</li>
<li>Michael Hill
</li>
<li>Doyle Bramhall II</li>
</ul>

Seed artist of Led Zeppelin:

<ul><li>LED</li>
<li>Deep Purple
</li>
<li>Bonham</li>
<li>Page and Plant</li>
<li>Black Sabbath</li>
<li>Aerosmith</li>
<li>The Who</li>
<li>Bad Company</li>
<li>AC/DC</li>
<li>Cream</li></ul>

Seed artist of Miles Davis:

<ul><li>Miles David and John Coltrane</li>
<li>Miles Davis Sextet</li>
<li>Miles Davis Quintet</li>
<li>John Coltrane</li>
<li>Charlie Parker</li>
<li>Kenny Dorham</li>
<li>Wayne Shorter</li>
<li>Wynton Marsalis</li>
<li>Bill Evans</li>
<li>Thelonious Monk</li></ul>

Seed artist of the Beatles

<ul><li>Badfinger</li>
<li>George Harrison</li>
<li>The Hollies</li>
<li>The Animals</li>
<li>John Lennon and Paul McCartney</li>
<li>Paul McCartney</li>
<li>The Beau Brummels</li>
<li>The fourmost</li>
<li>Peter and Gordon</li>
<li>George Martin</li></ul>

Seed artist of Emerson Lake and Palmer

<ul><li>Rick Wakeman</li>
<li>Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer</li>
<li>Patrick Moraz</li>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>Gentle Giant</li>
<li>Steve Hackett</li>
<li>King Crimson</li>
<li>Colosseum</li>
<li>Tony Banks</li>
<li>Graham Bond</li></ul>

<p></p>
The recommendations, for the most part look pretty good. There's less 
popularity bias than you'd typically see with a collaborative filtering 
algorithm.  Still, there are some funny bits.  If you like Miles Davis, 
there are 3 other types of Miles Davis that you might like (but I bet 
you could have figured that out without a fancy recommender). Also, 
cover and tribute bands seem to feature prominently.
<p></p>
There were a few little glitches with the web services.  The returned 
XML was not always well formed ('&amp;' characters were not properly 
turned into entities), some artist searches failed for no apparent 
reason (I couldn't find 'the beatles' or 'weezer' with the 'suggest' 
call).
<p></p>
 I'm not sure if these recommendations would pass the <a href="music_recommender_turing_test_results.html">recommender Turing test</a>.
 Not too many people would offer a recommendation of Lennon and 
McCartney for Beatles
fans - it is too obvious.  Same with Jimi Hendrix and the Jimi Hendrix 
Experience. However, the Graham Bond recommendation for Emerson Lake and
 Palmer is brilliant and one that I've never seen made by any other 
recommender (human or machine).
<p></p>
The Echo Nest gives these recommendations for free (for up to a certain 
amount per day). If you want to make many requests, you can buy a 
license from the nest.  Also, the Echo Nest is offering free unlimited 
recommendations to the first 100 small music sites that register for the
 API.  You can't beat free, <a href="http://the.echonest.com/recommend/earlybird.html">so sign up quick</a>!
<p></p>
I'm really pleased to see the Echo Nest releasing these services.  This 
is just the type of service that the next generation web companies that 
are trying new ways to deliver music really need.

				The first thing I'll do (well, 2nd after filing the expense report), is to download and install <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/">Hudson</a>.
  Hudson is tool for building and testing software projects 
continuously.  It makes it easier for developers to integrate, test and 
obtain the freshest, tested build.  Hudson manages distributed building 
and testing, integerates with all of the major source code control 
systems, works with JUnit, Findbugs, makes RSS feeds for build status.  I
 was really impressed with the demo that I saw at JavaOne.  Installing 
it was dead simple:

Just Download the jar and type <strong><pre>java -jar hudson.war</pre></strong>
<p>
If Hudson works as well as it seemed to in the JavaOne talk, then I 
think we'll be using this as our build and integration tool for Project 
Aura.

	<div class="entry-content">
				Notes from the Tech Talk at the SanFran music tech summit. This 
panel was a discussion about the technology behind some of the most 
popular music sites. Moderator is Colin Brumelle.
<p>
<img src="support_files/_photo.jpg" alt="photo.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_photo-1.jpg" alt="photo-1.jpg" border="0"></p><p>
Panelists:

</p><ul>
<li>Colin Brumelle - Moderator 
</li><li>Tom Conrad - CTO Pandora
</li><li>Marc Urbaitel - CTO In-Ticketing
</li><li>Shaun Haber - Warner Bros. Records - Director of operations, using Drupal to build an artist platform.
</li><li>Jeremy Riney - Project Playlist, CTO, Founder
</li><li>Jack Moffit  - Xiph, Chesspark - IM, gaming
</li></ul>

Why did you chose a particular type of technology:
<p>
Marc - uses php - quicker turnaround time, lets them be much more nimble. Open source is good.
</p><p>
Shaun - open source CMS - chose Drupal: a big reason is active developer community.
</p><p>
Jeremy - also uses Drupal - Paylist is the largest Drupal user with 25 million active users.
</p><p>
Tom - were on Java, Oracle, Jetty servlets due to legacy reasons.  
Oracle was a disaster, so they ported it all to postgres. Re-implemented
 Oracle procesdures at the Java language.  Some core routines in C, - 
huge memcachd  - 200 servers, 2000 interactions per second. 64 bits 
linux, intel CPUs, the shiny frontend is flash. They didn't have anyone 
who knows about flash. Used openLazlo to build the application using 
javascript and their framework and compile it down to flash.  Tom says 
Lazlo is a great piece of software.  
</p><p>
Jack - Perl, then Python, with webware frameworks, mysql, postgres, now 
Jango (rails-like python), they run everything on Amazon EC2 and S3.  
Wrote lots of Javascript - use all scriptaculous, prototype and others.
</p><p>
Colin: Is EC2 the future? 
</p><p>
Jack - Went through CO-LO hell.  Was hard to provision new hardware.  On
 Amazon, they can type one command and get 10 more machines.  Jack is 
very happy with EC2, S3. Jeremy was concerned with complexity but Jack 
says it was not too hard.
</p><p>
Tom: If they were starting today, they would be considering cloud 
computing like EC2. The hardest part to scale horizontally is the 
database.  Risk become predicting the future. How do you provision just 
the right amount of servers. This would become a guessing game.
</p><p>
Marc uses cloud computing to do scaling testing (buying lots of tickets at once).
</p><p> 
Tom - also the cloud is useful for data recovery - use the cloud to 
serve as the failover. Pandora decided to do their own CDN. The save 
much money they by doing it themselves.
</p><p>
Tom says don't by <a href="http://www.foundrynet.com/products/app-switch/">Foundry load balancers</a>

</p><p>
Questions from Derick of CDBaby -  Tells the story about how he rewrote 
CD Baby for PHP and Ruby On Rails. After 2 years of frustration, he 
threw it all away. Nothing to do with Rails - but keeping the two 
systems (PHP and Rails) alive was hard.  Derick also lauds EC2.  Tom 
does say that you are still paying a margin to Amazon for this so it 
could cost you more than doing it yourself.
</p><p>
Tom talks about "test driven development".  They can rip their system 
apart and put it back together and be confident that it will work 
because of their tests

The digital thought leaders panel  moderated by Brian Zisk, with Tim 
Westergren of Pandora, Aza Raskin of Songza, Michael Pertricone of the 
consumer electronics association and Ty Roberts of Gracenote/Sony.  <br>
<br>
First topic is the well-worn topic of how we navigate the intellectual 
property minefield of music.  How can companies make money while still 
compensating artists.  I wish the panel would focus a bit more about 
technology and less on rights and IP. There's a separate legal track. As
 K7lim says "this is a kindergarten discussion of IP policy."<br>
<br>
Tim Westegren calls for better, simpler design is necessary to engage 
with listeners, especially new listeners.  "Simplicity brings people in"
 says Aza.<br>
<br>
Brian asks: "What is the Future?" - Ty  Roberts talks about music 
product. He's interested in 'music packaging' - augmenting the simple 
MP3 with all of the ancillary metadata (album art, reviews and bios).  
Aza suggests 'continuity of experience'.   Eliminate the facebook.iTunes
 silos - get rid of having to worry about where your music is coming 
from.  Michael says it is 'Simplicity'<br>
<br>
Tim points out that radio has always been popular.  He says that people 
don't want to spend alot of time administrating their listening 
experience.  He suggest that music will be everywhere, supporting by 
advertising.  Once this is in place, there will be lots of ways that 
people can use and interact with the music. <br>
<br>
Aza points to the Kindle as a good example of where things should go 
with music.  "Feels like free" is key - whether it is ad supported or 
some other model.
<p>
Discussion about the "metadata problem".  
</p><p>
Tim offers advice to artists - add a new member of the band - a 
non-musician - to be the marketing person to get the band exposure on 
the 'nets.
