That means I'll be able to carry around a quarter-million songs in my
pocket.&nbsp; At the current iTunes rate of $.99 per song thats about a
quarter million dollars worth of music.&nbsp; Of course, we may be
filling this up with episodes of Lost or video pod casts, nevertheless,
it will be easy to carry a&nbsp; substantial fraction

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				
<a href="https://musicbrainz.org/"><img src="support_files/mb-banner.png"></a><br>
<br>
Continuing our look at sources of music metadata ... we now visit <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz.</a>
MusicBrainz is a 'community music metadatabase that attempts to create
a comprehensive musc information site.' MusicBrainz has done something
that the All Music guide and MusicMoz have not done, they've
incorporated music fingerprinting technology that will provide a unique
MusicBrainz ID for any music file (regardless of encoding or format).&nbsp; In some sense, MusicBrainz is a lot like <a href="http://www.gracenote.com/">GraceNote</a> or <a href="http://www.freedb.org/">FreeDB</a>
in that they focus on providing information required to properly tag an
MP3 file, but unlike GraceNote and Freedb they work not just with audio
CDs but (in theory) any music track.<br>
<br>
The MusicBrainz data is entirely community generated and are released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0">creative commons </a>license or into the public domain and is available for <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/products/server/download.html">download.</a><br>
<br>
MusicBrainz provides detailed album and track information for most
mainstream artists.&nbsp; It doesn't provide much beyond this
however.&nbsp; If you look up a track in MusicBrainz, you'll find:<br>
<ul>
  <li>The MusicBrainz ID</li>
  <li>The track length</li>
  <li>Link to the album page</li>
  <li>Link the artist page</li>
</ul>
If you look up an artist you'll find:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A one-liner description (if you are lucky) of the band</li>
  <li>Links to 'official band homepages' and wikipedia entries</li>
  <li>Albums lists</li>
  <li>A limited set of related artists<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Notably missing are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Genres</li>
  <li>Reviews</li>
</ul>
One interesting bit of information that MusicBrainz provides that is
not available anywhere else is a 'lookup count'. For each track, it is
possible to find out how many times the database was queried for the
track.&nbsp; This is useful for tracking song popularity.<br>
<br>
All in all, MusicBrainz is a real good thing. They provide free access
to the data, provide SDKs for apps to use to hookup to the DB, and
provide excellent documentation.&nbsp; Hopefully overtime, the
community will be able to fill out some of the gaps in the MusicBrainz
data.<br>

This week, Seattle is hosting<a href="http://sc05.supercomputing.org/about/home.php"> SC/05</a>, the yearly conference on high
performance computing, networking and storage.&nbsp; A new initiative
this year at SC/05 is <a href="http://sc05.supercomputing.org/initiatives/hpc-analytics.php">HPC Analytics</a>.&nbsp; The goal of this initiative
is to highlight "rigorous and sophisticated methods of data analysis
and visualization used in high performance computing by showcasing
powerful analytics applications solving complex, real-world problems."</span></font></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>
<p><font size="3">One of the HPC Analytics finalist is a submission by D</font>r. S<font class="body" size="3">tephen
Downie from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign called <a href="http://sc05.supercomputing.org/schedule/event_detail.php?evid=5409">Terascale Music Mining</a>. The
project's mission is the 'creation of secure, accessible, terascale
collections of music materials in a variety of audio, symbolic and
metadata forms. These collections, coupled with a set of standardized
experimental tasks and standardized evaluation metrics, will allow
members of the international MIR/MDL research community to participate
in the newly created, TREC-like, Music Information Retrieval Evaluation
eXchange (MIREX) contests.'<br>
</font></p>
<div style="text-align: left;">
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<p><font class="body" size="3">Dr.
Downie's submission includes some work that Kris West and I did over
the summer as part of the <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/mirex2005/index.php/Audio_Artist_Identification">MIREX 2005 artist identification
</a>submission.&nbsp;&nbsp; For MIREX 2005, we created a system that&nbsp;
analyzes a set of MP3 audio files and attempt to identify the performing
artist of the audio based only upon the audio.&nbsp; The system is
implemented in<a href="http://www.music-ir.org/evaluation/m2k/"> Music-to-Knowledge (M2K)</a> an open-source system for
developing large-scale music analysis systems.&nbsp; The system is a
good example of the kind of problem that can only be solved with large
or distributed computing systems.&nbsp; Our M2K submission took about
10 hours to analyze 1500 audio files.&nbsp; If we wanted to scale the
same algorithms up to an iTunes-sized music collection, we'd need about
a year of CPU processing time to perform the analysis.&nbsp; Two things
seem pretty clear to me. Music analysis is going to be a big part of
helping people find relevant music (i.e music that they want to listen
to), and companies that want to do this sort of analysis are going to
need some pretty <a href="http://www.sun.com/service/sungrid/overview.jsp">big and fast</a> computers.</font></p>

On my nightstand this week is the book called <a href="http://www.alibris.com/search/search.cfm?S=R&amp;qwork=8833735&amp;qsort=p&amp;siteID=Pw2LQAj_zJk-kuEsF9LvHLlZnKqf2IBJyw">The Future of Music</a>.
This book offers a look at what changes are going to happen in the
music industry over the next 10 years.&nbsp; Author David Kusek does an
excellent job describing the current state of the music industry, how
we got to where we are, and what is going to change. Kusek says that
soon: 'Music will flow like water'.&nbsp; We will have easy and
ubiquitous access to music, and just like water it will be (or at least
seem to be) free.&nbsp; That doesn't mean that people won't make money
selling music.&nbsp; Just like Evian can make a profit selling bottled
water at a price more expensive than gasoline, there will still be a
way for people to make money selling music. It's just that the current
recording industry won't hold the keys to the kingdom as they do
now.&nbsp; An excellent book for anyone in the business of bringing
music to the consumer.&nbsp; (Thanks Matthew for the suggestion).<br>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p> Yesterday, I described the <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/">All Music Guide</a>,
 one of the best sources of music metadata. Unfortunately, all this good
 data is not free. However there are some good sources of music metadata
 that <b> are </b> free.  Now these sites don't provide the as comprehensive a set of data, but they still   provide a good place to start. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://musicmoz.org/"><img src="support_files/logo1.gif"></a>
</p><p>
One good source of free metadata is <a href="http://musicmoz.org/">MusicMoz</a>.
  MusicMoz is a "comprehensive directory of all things music, edited by 
volunteers."  The data is available for use under a very friendly <a href="http://musicmoz.org/xml/license.html">Use License</a>. 
</p><p>
MusicMoz provides full dumps of their database in XML format, (about 10 
Megabytes compressed).  However, the latest data dump is almost 4  
months old (compare that to the daily updates that the All Music guide 
will give you).  You can also get access to the data via a web services 
interface. Here's the results for a query for <a href="http://musicmoz.org/search/search.cgi?search=franz%20ferdinand&amp;xml=1">
Franz Ferdinand</a>. You may notice that the latest album by Franz 
Ferdinand - "You could have it so much better" is not listed in the 
MusicMoz database. That is the biggest problem with MusicMoz, the data 
is a bit thin.  Compare the <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;uid=MIW020511032118&amp;sql=11:sudgyl64xpzb%7ET2">All Music Guide data for Franz Ferdinand</a> to the <a href="http://musicmoz.org/Bands_and_Artists/F/Franz_Ferdinand/">MusicMoz data for Franz Ferdinand</a>.  There's quite a difference.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/franz&#32;ferdinand.jpg">
</p><p>
MusicMoz does have a pretty good search query language, it contains a 
number of operators that let you restrict queries to various fields.
</p><p>
All in all, MusicMoz has pretty good data, gives you pretty good access to it,  has an excellent license and the price is right.

If you are building any sort of music search system, sooner or later you
 are going to need a good source for music metadata such as artist, 
albums, tracks, related artists, biographies, reviews, album art etc.  
One of the first places to look for good metadata is the <a href="http://allmusic.com/">All Music Guide</a>.
  AMG has been in the business of supplying music metadata since 1992.  
The AMG database is probably one of the most complete database.  They 
provide detailed artist biographies, discographies, group membership, 
similar artists, influences,  song covers and much more.  There's a 
whole lot there.  However, it is a commercial database. There's no free 
access to the data except via the website.  If you want access to the 
data you have to get a license from AMG and it is not cheap.  You could 
probably buy about 30 <a href="http://www.sun.com/desktop/workstation/ultra20/">Sun Ultra 20s</a> for what you'd pay for a year's access to the AMG database.</p><p>

</p><p>
The All Music guide is the Cadillac of music metadata.  It has all of the data that you'd ever want, but you have to pay for it.

Remember the old Napster? One of the best things about the original 
Napster was that you could browse someone else's music collection and 
sample music.  If you found someone that had lots of music that you 
liked, you could explore their collection and find music that you hadn't
 heard before. It was a great way to find new music.  
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.mercora.com/radio.asp"><img src="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/support_files/header_logo.jpg"></a></p>
The music search company Mercora is trying to bring this type of social 
exploring back again. With Mercora you can browse and listen to your 
friend's music, and your friends can listen to your music too.  Of 
course to avoid the copyright police they limit this: you can't copy 
your friends music and only 5 people can be listening to one person's 
music at a time.
<p>
Mercora is all about discovering music ... there's lots more to Mercora 
than just peeking in on your friends music ... worth checking out 
(Windows only for now ...)

				<p>In 1957, Arthur C. Clarke predicted the  automated content-based analysis of music (so prevalent in field of <b>Music Information Retrieval</b> today) in the short story called <b>The Ultimate Melody</b>.  In this story, scientist Gilbert Lister:
</p><p>
<font color="green">
 "took hundreds of the really famous tunes in classical and popular 
music and analysed their structure - their morphology, as he put it.  
This was done automatically by a big harmonic analyser that sorted out 
all of the frequencies.

</p><p>
It is a cautionary tale however, not all goes well for Gilbert, MIR researchers should take heed.
</p><p>
<i>The Ultimate Melody</i> can be found in <i>Tales from the White Hart</i> published in 1957. (Thanks to Sun Labs' Tim Curry for pointing me to this story).

I've been spending a good deal of time delving into the <a href="http://coltrane.music.mcgill.ca/ACE/features.html">jAudio</a>
 package from McGill University. jAudio is an open source package for 
extracting features from music. The features can then be processed by 
other packages such as Weka, M2K or ACE.  The authors of jAudio have 
done a very good job of architecting, coding and documenting the jAudio 
system. The jAudio code has been just super to work on.  I've added some
 code  to jAudio to allow us to distribute our feature extractions over a
 large number of CPUs. Since feature extraction can be a very 
CPU-intensive task, being able to distribute the task is key.  With  
jAudio we can process audio at about 10 seconds per 3 minute song so 
processing a 5,000 song collection will take about 14 hours, but with 
the extended jAudio it is just as easy to run this task on 10 CPUs and 
get it done in 2 hours, or run it  on a 1000 node system and get the job
 done in just a couple of minutes. 
</p><p>
You can read more about jAudio in Cory McKay's paper <a href="http://www.music.mcgill.ca/%7Ecmckay/papers/musictech/jAudio.pdf">jAudio: Towards a standardized extensible audio music feature extraction system</a>

Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music is worth a visit.  This nifty website
 lets you explore and listen to the nearly 200 different genres of 
electronic dance music.  Each top level genre (house, trance, techno, 
etc) is broken down into a network of subgenera, with clusters, 
dependencies and hierarchies represented.  There's lots of info 
presented in a visually engaging way, but the best part of the site is 
being able to listen to examples of all of the various genres.  If you 
don't know the difference between JPop and Eurodance, this is the place 
to go.

The weekend I took another look at the MusicMagic mixer by Predixis.  My <a href="discovering_music.html">first attempt</a>
 to use this system failed (apparently the 64-bit linux is not on the 
top of their priority platforms), but I do have a Mac Mini, and they 
support that so I tried it again on  this platform. This time with much 
better results.  
</p><p>
Using MusicMagic mixer is very easy to use. You point it at your music 
collection and it will go off and fingerprint and analyze the music.  
The fingerprinting process (similar to what <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>
  does) takes about 3 to 5 seconds per song. The fingerprint is used to 
query the Predixis database to see if an analysis for the song has 
already been performed, if so, the analysis portion can be skipped.  If 
no analysis is found, then the song will be analysed and a number of 
musical features are extracted. The analysis is a very CPU intensive 
process and typically takes about 80% of the playing time.  I pointed 
MusicMagic mixer at my collection of music (about 4,500 songs).  
Unfortunately, the fingerprinter did not findi many matches so most of 
my music will need to be analyzed.  For this modest sized collection, 
this will take nearly 2 weeks of continuous CPU time on my poor little 
Mac Mini.  

</p><p> Fortunately, I don't have to wait until all songs are analyzed 
before I can play with the system.  I can ask MusicMagic mixer to create
 an' 'instant mix' and it will generate a playlist of 10 songs that are 
acoustically similar. It does this by selecting a song at random from my
 1500 analyzed songs and then selecting the 9 songs that are nearest to 
the seed song in this music similarity space.  If I like the playlist 
generated, I can toss it into iTunes and listen to it, or I can easily 
generate another one.  Once the initial analysis is performed, 
MusicMagic mixer is very fast, the playlists were generated instantly.  
The generated playlists, so far, seem to be quite good (but it is hard 
to tell with only 1500 songs analyzed).  The songs in a playlist are 
typically in the same genre, and often include several songs by the same
 artist, but also include a variety of artists.  I occasionally will 
encounter a 'clunker', a song that just doesn't belong (a harpsichord 
piece after a delta blues song).  I'm looking forward to using the 
system once the full analysis is complete to see how well it performs.
</p><p>
The Predixis folks seem to know what they are doing and they seem to be 
hooking up with all the right partners.  It will be interesting to see 
if they can make a go of this. The music recommender space is starting 
to attract a number of players, big and small, Predixis is the only one 
that is using automatic music analysis to drive recommendations, so 
they've carved out an interesting niche.

Over 20 years ago, Computer Science Icon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> published his in depth analysis of the complexity of song lyrics: <a href="http://home.galileo.edu/%7Eobonilla/fun/p344-knuth.pdf">The Complexity of Songs</a>.
  In this paper, Professor Knuth traces the efforts of lyricists over 
the ages as they seek to reduce the amount of memory required to 
represent a (seemingly) complex and interesting set of verses.  First, 
Knuth gives us the basic lemma and proof and then begins with the 
historical survey showing how the lyric complexity has been slowly 
reduced from N (the song length) to N^(1/2)  (old MacDonald) and 1 / 
log(n)^(1/2) for 'the 12 days of Christmas'.  The big breakthrough of 
course occurred with the "m Bottles of Beer on the wall" that reduced 
lyric complexity to O(log n).  Knuth concludes with an analysis of the 
latest attempts (as of 1984) in lyric complexity reduction by Mr KC of 
the sunshine band (uh huh uh huh).
</p><p>
SunLabs' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Steele">Guy Steele</a> has continued to push ahead with this area of research.  He has produced the <a href="http://www.poppyfields.net/filks/00222.html">Telnet song</a> with a complexity that approaches O(1).

I just finished reading <a href="http://battellemedia.com/">John Battelle's</a>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1591840880/qid=1128878299/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-5495849-8663853?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">The Search</a>.
  One interesting tidbit from the book: Battelle asked a senior manager 
why Google doesn't focus on searching and selling music. His answer was:
 <i>Sergey doesn't listen to much music</i>.
