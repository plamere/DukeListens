				I was listening to the <a href="http://hype.non-standard.net/">Hype Machine </a>this morning - and much to my surprise - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._3_%28Saint-Sa%C3%ABns%29">Camille Saints-Saen's Symphony #3 </a>started
 playing. This piece is also known as the 'organ symphony' and to me is 
one of the most exciting pieces of music of all time - this time, at the
 end of the piece, the final huge organ chord seemed to repeat itself - 
and then, much to my surprise it was joined by vocalist Win Butler - we 
had seemlessly segued into the song 'intervention' by The Arcade 
Fire.&nbsp; It made my day. &nbsp; The two songs were put together by <a href="http://howardwho.com/blog/2007/01/26/organ-intervention/">Howard Who</a>. Well done.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><img style="float: left;" src="support_files/remora.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">iTunes
 is the most popular way for people to play and organize their 
music.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hundreds of millions of people use iTunes. They use 
it because it has lots of good tools for organizing music, and works 
well with the ubiquitous iPod.&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that iTunes does 
not do very well is give new music recommendations.&nbsp; The 'Just for 
you' recommender only uses your iTunes purchases to make recommendations
 which for most people is just too slim of a dataset to build a 
recommendation around, and for many, the songs that they purchase 
through the iTunes store are the songs by artists that only want to try a
 song or two from, if they really like the artist, they'll go to the 
local shop and by the whole album.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This combination of
 ubiquity and poor recommendations has driven a whole industry of music 
recommenders that work with iTunes - these recommenders run as iTunes 
plugins, sidebars and tag-alongs. When you start iTunes, these programs 
also start up - they keep tabs on what you are listening to, and use 
this data to generate recommendations for you.&nbsp; These recommenders 
are like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remora">remoras</a> (aka 
suckerfish) to the iTunes shark.&nbsp; By attaching itself to a host 
such as a shark, a&nbsp; remora benefits by using the host as transport
and protection and also feeds on materials dropped by the host.&nbsp; 
The recommender remoras benefit from iTunes reach onto millions of 
desktops and feed on the opportunities left by iTunes poor recommender.</p><p>The
 problem for me is that when I start iTunes,&nbsp; a half-dozen 
recommenders start running too - there's last.fm, iLike, qloud, goombah,
 musicmobs, and mystrands - all ready to give me a recommendation.&nbsp;
 I can hear the remora sucking sound (it sounds like a CPU fan going on,
 trying to cool an overloaded CPU).&nbsp; Some of these recommenders are
 not so well behaved:&nbsp; MyStrands is using 150 mb of memory, iLike 
is using a whopping 350 mb of memory - Goombah is using 20% of my 
CPU.&nbsp; Add to that some questionable UI decisions - iLike attaches 
its UI to the side of iTunes,&nbsp; QLoud sticks their own button into 
iTunes itself (last.fm's scrobbler is a notable exception, it just sits 
quietly and invisibly in the toolbar where you can completely forget 
about it).</p><p>So the question is - is the remora model - the best way
 for a recommender to survive? To latch onto the big shark and feed on 
the scraps (and hope the shark doesn't take offense)? Or is it better to
 find your own niche independent of the big fish - such as the hype 
machine and Music IP are doing?<br></p>

Nothing new for anyone following this space, and quite a number of the 
details are wrong.&nbsp; I guess that's an indication of how confusing 
the music recommender space is. Lots of sites, lots of features that 
look similar between the sites.&nbsp; How do you tell which music 
recommender is better?<br><br>

<a href="http://www.streampad.com/"><img src="support_files/steampad_logo.gif" style="float: left;" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">Streampad</a>
 is a web music player.&nbsp; Its not just a music player that plays in 
your browser. Its a music player that&nbsp; plays the web.&nbsp; With 
streampad you can type in the name of an artist and streampad will 
return a list of songs by the artist that are on the web. Click on a 
song to hear it, click on 'add all' to play them all.&nbsp; Interested 
in listening to a new band like Deerhoof? Streampad knows of at least 50
 songs that you can listen to.&nbsp; If you would like to learn a bit 
more about a particular song, click on the 'read' link - this will bring
 you to a review of the track (via the <a href="http://hype.non-standard.net/">hypemachine).</a> </p><p>&nbsp;Streampad hooks up to several music sites on the web.&nbsp; It hooks up to <a href="http://mp3tunes.com/">Mp3Tunes</a>,
 the music locker so you can listen to your music wherever you go.&nbsp;
 It will stuff your listening data into your last.fm account (if you 
give them your last.fm login info).&nbsp; It will show streampad 
listeners on a google map (everyone has to have a google map mashup 
nowadays apparently). It will show you up coming concerts (although it 
didn't seem to care about where I lived, so I was seeing concert info 
for shows that were thousands of miles away).&nbsp; <br></p><p>Streampad
 can also be used to give you access to your own music collection when 
you are on the road.&nbsp; Streampad has a little server that runs on 
your computer that will serve up your music collection so whereever you 
are you can listen to your home music collection.&nbsp; For those of us 
that have terrabyte-sized music collections that don't fit on an iPod or
 a laptop.</p><p>Streampad is another example of the <a href="the_universal_music_player.html">universal music player</a>
 -&nbsp; it lets you play music from any source - helping you to play 
your music where ever you are (as long as you are connected to the web).
 However, as with the current crop of universal players, Streampad 
doesn't offer much in the way of tools for helping you find new music - 
you have to already know that you want to listen to some Deerhoof when 
you get to Streampad.&nbsp; I'm hoping the next generation of web-based 
music players will start to incorporate some music discovery tools.<br></p>

In anticipation of the soon to be released album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_Opportunity">Friend Opportunity</a>, I've been listening to a lot of music by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deerhoof">Deerhoof.</a>
  This is quirky stuff to be sure - but it is growing on me. The neat 
thing is that I can listen to Deerhoof all day to let it grow on me for 
free and it is all perfectly legal.  Here's how:<br><ul><li>
 Generate a link to a playlist (in <a href="http://xspf.org/">XSPF</a> format) of Deerhoof's top 50 tracks using last.fm's web services.  The link is: <a href="https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/Deerhoof/toptracks.xspf">http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/Deerhoof/toptracks.xspf.</a></li></ul>
<ul><li>&nbsp;Plug this XSPF url into the <a href="http://xspfresolver.com/">XspfResolver</a> and tell it to 'Napsterize'.  This generates a <a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/SpiffyContentResolver/napsterize?input=http%3A%2F%2Fws.audioscrobbler.com%2F1.0%2Fartist%2FDeerhoof%2Ftoptracks.xspf">pretty printed version of the playlist</a>
 with links into the Napster catalog to play the songs (remember that 
Napster lets you listen to each song in their million+ song catalog 5 
times for free).  At the bottom of this page is a Napster link for the 
entire playlist.  Click on that link to start listening to the top 50 
Deerhoof songs. (Or just click <a href="http://play.napster.com/tracks/18657125,16040208,14133170,14131143,16040213,16040207,16040209,14133166,16040216,14133171,16040214,16040211,18657126,16040212,14131141,16040215,16040210,16040217,14133164,14133169,14133162,16040219,14133173,16040218,14131146,14133174,16040226,14131137,14133172,15336174,14133163,16040224,16040223,16040225,14131304,14131302,16040222,14131303,14131136,14131139,14131142">here</a> if you are a bit lazy).</li></ul>

I think this example shows what music is going to be like on the web in 
the near future.  Some websites will provide playlists (last.fm in this 
example), some websites will provide services to resolve these playlists
 to a particular catalog or catalogs (the XspfResolver in this case), 
and other sites will provide the music (like Napster is doing here).  
It's all part of the new emerging music ecosystem.  One more step closer
 to the day when <a href="http://www.futureofmusicbook.com/">music flows like water.</a>

				There's music scattered all over the web. Its in mp3blogs, on 
MySpace pages, in deep databases like eMusic, Napster or Rhapsody. Its 
in music lockers like mp3tunes.&nbsp; In addition, there are all sorts 
of sites such as <a href="http://musicmobs.com/">MusicMobs,</a> <a href="http://webjay.org/">WebJay</a>&nbsp; or <a href="http://www.artofthemix.org/index.asp">ArtOfTheMix</a>
 where you can find interesting playlists.&nbsp;  But even though 
there's an abundance of music out there on the web, its not so easy to 
hear it.&nbsp; It is hard to share playlists, its hard to gather up a 
good collection of this music.&nbsp; But things are going to get 
better.&nbsp; First, there's the <a href="http://musicdns.org/">MusicDNS</a>
 song id, that gives us a way to unambiguously identify a song from the 
audio and&nbsp; clean up the metadata - then there's the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> music metadatabase that gives us all sorts of interesting data about the music, and then there's <a href="http://xspf.org/">XSPF,</a>&nbsp;
 an XML-based playlist format.&nbsp; Combine these three technologies 
and we start to get a web where we can&nbsp; listen to music, share 
music,&nbsp; pass around playlists.&nbsp; Imagine a future where any 
time that you see the name of a song on the web you can hear the song - 
anytime someone gives you a list of songs in a playlist you can hear the
 playlist.&nbsp; This future <a href="http://www.futureofmusicbook.com/">where music flows like water</a>
 is just around the corner.&nbsp; Soon we will see web enabled music 
players that will use song ids, MusicBrainz and XSPF to give us just 
that.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the first universal players is <a href="http://grabb.it/info/about">Grabb.it</a>
 - Grabb.it (in invitation-only mode) will resolve playlists to songs 
located on the web.&nbsp; It's early days for this sort of thing, but I 
think that these universal players<img style="float: right;" src="support_files/grabbit_small.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"> and song resolvers like Grabb.it (and my humble attempt at an <a href="http://xspfresolver.com/">XspfResolver)</a>
 are going to be a big part of the emerging celestial 
jukebox.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grabb.it looks pretty cool, I love the URL, I love 
the logo, and I love the idea - I can't wait to see it go live.<br>

				<p><a href="http://criticalmetrics.com/"><img src="support_files/logo9b.html" style="float: right;" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>Most
 of the new tools for music discovery revolve around collaborative 
filtering - relying on the wisdom of the crowds - but sometimes crowds 
turn into mobs and are not always so wise.&nbsp; CF systems have a 
number of well known problems: cold-start issues, popularity bias, 
inertia. &nbsp; One new music discovery tool that rejects the wisdom of 
the crowds model is CriticalMetrics.&nbsp; CriticalMetrics makes 
recommendations based on what the experts are saying.&nbsp; They mine 
the ratings of dozens of music review publications (from the New York 
Times and the Rolling Stones to&nbsp; many small pubs like<a href="http://www.paperthinwalls.com/"> Paper Thin Walls</a> and <a href="http://www.urb.com/">URB)</a>
 and recommend music that has received rave reviews. &nbsp; 
CriticalMetrics lets you listen to the songs, filter them, put links to 
them in your blog: (Here's an artist&nbsp; I found that I liked:&nbsp; <a href="http://criticalmetrics.com/demo/share_song/3204">Art Brut</a>).</p><p>It's a pretty cool site - and a great way to find new music.<br></p>

				<p>Everyone I know is pretty jazzed about the new iPhone.&nbsp; It 
is a pretty nice looking device.&nbsp; I was excited to hear that it was
 running OS X - perhaps we'd finally have an iPod with an SDK - an iPod 
that we could write software for.&nbsp; Alas, that is not the case - 
only Apple can put applications on the iPhone.&nbsp; Sure,&nbsp; Apple 
is the master of design but there are lots of really interesting ideas 
about new ways to interact with a music collection. Wouldn't it be nice 
if we could put these interfaces on an iPod?&nbsp; Here are some nifty
