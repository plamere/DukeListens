			<h2>GWT at JavaOne</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I was really looking forward to the GWT talk at JavaOne (and 
apparently so were many others, there seemed to be a thousand in the 
room during the talk).&nbsp; The talk was presented by two of the core 
GWT team members.&nbsp; They did a super job giving the talk - they were
 relaxed, were polished in their presentation, used humor, didn't get 
fazed by AV glitches.&nbsp; They talked a bit about the philosophy 
behind GWT. They put some stakes in the ground - 'static typing&nbsp; is
 good, dynamic typing is not so good', lots of sexy widgets not so 
important as user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to bring software 
engineering to web development.&nbsp; They claim (and I agree) that it 
is hard to engineer a pile of steaming javascript.&nbsp; Java is much 
better for all its 'abilities' - maintability, adaptability, etc.&nbsp; </p><p>They
 had some good metrics about how users react to load time.&nbsp; If your
 app takes too long, your users will leave.&nbsp; They have a 300ms goal
 for a load time of a rich GWT application - and they are working hard 
always to reduce load time.&nbsp; They do this in a number of ways - 
they use the browser cache to help of course, they make the code they 
ship over the wire be very compressible, and they reduce the overall 
number of http requests (compare that to what is typically done with a 
traditional ajax app, where there may be many trips to the server just 
to get all of the javascript).&nbsp; GWT build separage JS bundles for 
the different browsers, so if you are running in firefox, you don't have
 any IE specific JS.&nbsp; One really neat optimization they are doing 
is called 'image bundles'.&nbsp; Apps that have lots of static images 
can take a long time to load since each image is a separate HTTP 
request.&nbsp; GWT can bundle all of these images into a single image. 
So your app only has to do a single HTTP request to get the images. They
 can then use windowing within this larger image to display the various 
images.&nbsp; A very clever technique.&nbsp; GWT also includes a timing 
framework so you can easily instrument your app so you can see how long 
it takes the app to load.</p><p>They showed some demos ... I was a bit 
disappointed here since they just showed the demos that are available on
 the GWT site. I was also disappointed that they didn't talk much about 
where they were going, what new features were on the roadmap.</p><p>During
 the Q/A one audience member asked about how to write a GWT app that 
could be crawled by search engines like google.&nbsp; The GWT guys knew 
about this problem and they are indeed working hard on making GWT sites 
crawlable.</p><p>&nbsp;All in all, a good session.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>

                Interesting stuff.  I have always wondered, however, why
 the majority of the web programming sphere is wed to the idea of 
building all these applications within the current browser architecture,
 and on top of HTTP.  To me, it makes much more sense to build rich 
internet applications outside of the browser, using the full 
capabilities of the desktop.  And to build them on top of TCP directly, 
instead of all these hacks atop HTTP.  I mean, look at the name of the 
protocol itself: Hypertext transfer.  It seems very silly that we are 
now building all these rich internet applications, everything from 
Pandora to Zillow, on top of a protocol that was designed for hypertext.
  

A few weeks ago, I read something about researchers wanting to scrap IP 
and start over.  Why wouldn't we also scrap HTTP, and start over at that
 layer, too?

                Jeremy - I think the biggest advantage for doing web 
apps in the browser is that the browser is already on 100% of the 
desktops.  There's no install time, no futzing with install scripts, 
there's a security model that is supposed to protect you from malicious 
programmers.  The google gwt folks talked about a 300ms window of 
opportunity.  Take longer than that and your site starts to lose 
visitors.  If people have to install some software before they can use 
your site, you've lost many, many potential users.

                Hrm.. yes.  I have heard that "browser is already 
installed" reasoning a number of times.  I think that is one of the 
fundamental pillars of "web" 2.0.   But how many more Myspacian social 
networking sites can the world create before we say "enough", and clamor
 for something newer, bigger, more interesting than the software that 
lives inside a web browser box?  

Maybe I am just in the minority, and the market won't cater to someone 
like me.  But I have seriously considered puchasing IP media servers so 
that I can listen to Pandora without a web browser, without a computer 
on at all.  Just my router, media streamer, and stereo speakers.  To me,
 that sort of Ubicomp application of Pandora's service is all about 
"Internet" 2.0, rather than strictly "web" 2.0.  

I think the browser is actually a two-edged sword. Yes, it is already 
installed on every computer.  But it is such a small box, and it is very
 difficult to squeeze much interesting into it.  I guess I just don't 
buy the argument that the only way to get people to use your 
software/service is to have it inside a browser.  Two big 
counterexamples are iTunes and Google Earth.  Somehow, lots of people 
still download and install that software.  And you can do things in that
 rich application area that you simply cannot do on the web.  There is a
 reason why Google Earth is not a web app.
