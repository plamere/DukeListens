				<br><br><a href="http://www.dimvision.com/musicmap/" target="_self">MusicMap</a>
 is a neat flash app that lets you explore artist similarity. MusicMap 
uses the 'similar artists data' from Amazon to form a graph of connected
 similar artists.&nbsp; In concept, it is identical to <a href="http://www.liveplasma.com/" target="_self">LivePlasma</a>
 (formerly MusicPlasma), but I've always found the LivePlasma interface 
to be awkward and confusing and downright slow.&nbsp; MusicMaps is quite
 intuitive and really quite zippy.&nbsp; You can explore an artist 
similarity space quite easily. This biggest problem with this app is 
that you can't listen to any music.&nbsp; You may find that ColdPlay is 
similar to the White Stripes, but you can't listen to either.&nbsp;

				<br>You may have read in <a target="_self" href="http://blogs.sun.com/page/jonathan?entry=niagara_benchmarks">Jonathan's blog</a> about how <a target="_self" href="http://podbop.org/">PodBop</a> was voted the most popular mashup at <span class="body">David Berlind's </span><a target="_self" href="http://www.mashupcamp.com/">MashUp Unconference</a><span class="body">.&nbsp;
 PodBop is a web2.0 mashup that scours the web for mp3s of bands that 
are coming to a nearby venue.&nbsp; With PodBop your three steps to live
 music are:<br></span>
<ol>
<li id="one">Enter your city and state.</li>
<li id="two">Listen to bands that are in <strong>your town</strong> this week.</li>
<li id="three">Go see a concert.</li></ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Ace MIR reporter/analyst Jeremy Pickens says:<br></div><br><pre style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;" wrap="">There is not really any “content based” music IR in this system, but it is perhaps a good example of a metadata-based search tool.  Musical “relevance” might have time+location features attached to it.  To be able to go and listen to a few tracks from some unknown band who’ll be playing down the road from you next week is extremely useful.  It’s another form of music information discovery.<br><br></pre>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Jeremy goes on to say:<br></div><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><pre wrap=""><span style="font-style: italic;">Imagine also a reverse tool, where bands decide which cities they should tour in, based on the music preferences of fans using this service in various cities.  Reverse music IR ... <span style="font-weight: bold;">Music trying to find the fans.</span></span><br></pre></div> <br>Lots
 of interesting possibilities to be sure.  It'd be interesting if some 
of the music discovery services such as last.fm or musicmobs collected 
some extra bits of data such as the geographic location of the listener,
 it would open the doors for all sorts of geographic based MIR systems. 
 Ian Knopke of McGill university presented a <a target="_self" href="http://ismir2005.ismir.net/proceedings/1132.pdf">paper</a>
 at ISMIR 2005 describing a technique for locating sound and music files
 geographically, but that is very different than finding where the 
listeners are located.  Maybe the next cool mashup would be a <a target="_self" href="http://www.frappr.com/">frappr</a>
 map that shows the spread of a new song from a new band from its first 
performances in the local club to the point when its spread across the 
country and appears on the Billboard charts.<span style="font-family: Times;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Times;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></font><br><br>Be sure to read PodBop creator Taylor McKnights blog:  <a target="_self" href="http://gtmcknight.com/">GTMCKNIGHT</a><br><br><br></span></span></span>

				<br>One of the great things about working on a project like '<a target="_self" href="http://research.sun.com/projects/dashboard.php?id=153">Search inside the Music</a>'
 is that I get to surround myself with music all day.&nbsp; I'm always 
listening to new music.&nbsp; For the last year I've been doing quite a 
bit of experimentation with music from <a target="_self" href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune.</a>&nbsp; <br><br><img src="support_files/magnatune_logo.gif" alt=""><br><br>Magnatune
 offers an incredibly diverse music collection from heavy metal and punk
 to classical, ethnic and folk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the songs, 
particularly by the band called the <a target="_self" href="http://magnatune.com/artists/strapons">strap-ons</a>, are well ... a bit edgy.&nbsp; They have one song called "<a target="_self" href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/strapons-geekcrime/09.m3u">this place sucks</a>",
 which starts out with the singer screaming "this place sucks, it's 
f**ked".&nbsp; A little while back, I was giving a rather high profile 
demo of our music similarity and visualization system. One of the 
attendees was <a target="_self" href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan">Jonathan Schwartz</a>,
 the president of Sun Microsystems.&nbsp; During the demo, I get to show
 how we can use our visualization to explore our music collection by 
clicking around in a 3D visualization.&nbsp; It occured to me during 
this particular demo that it would be rather unfortunate if I happened 
to launch "this place sucks" ... I'm sure Jonathan has a good sense of 
humor but ... well you never know.&nbsp; Anyway, I did manage to avoid 
that song during the demo and it went quite well. By the way, here's the
 visualization (the album art here is for a band named pizzle)<br><br><br><img src="support_files/ss.png"  ="" alt="search inside the music visualization" width="90%"><br><br>One of my favorites of the Magnatune artists is <a target="_self" href="http://www.fogelberg.com/">Bjorn Fogelberg</a>. His 'Karooshi porn' album is rhythmic, soft electronica, but with lots of solid analog synth sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; His "<a target="_self" href="http://magnatune.com/artists/albums/fogelberg-karooshi/11.m3u">Life in a tube</a>"
 has become the unofficial theme song of the Advanced Search and the 
Search Inside the music research teams.&nbsp; Every team should have 
such a good theme song.<br><br><img src="support_files/bf3.html" alt=""><br><br>

 details Amazon's plan to roll out a digital music service this 
summer.&nbsp; It is likely that Amazon's service will be centered around
 a branded digital music player (probably made by <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sg/products/audio/mp3player/index.asp" target="_self">Samsung</a>), and unlike iTunes offer an all-you-can-eat monthly subscription plan.&nbsp; <br><br>It
 will certainly be an uphill climb for Amazon. Apple&nbsp; has the 
player of choice and years of experience selling digital music. However,
 Amazon has some things going for them. In particular I like how they 
are always innovating. First of all, they have a great <a target="_self" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/104-2240058-5500763?node=12738641">web services API</a>
 that makes all sorts of web 2.0 style mashups possible.&nbsp; They are 
always thinking about new ways to hook people up with content. &nbsp; 
Their "Search Inside" feature, "<a target="_self" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search-inside/sipshelp.html/104-2240058-5500763">statistically improbable phrases</a>", and <a target="_self" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/sitb-next/0060512806/ref=sbx_txt/104-2240058-5500763?%5Fencoding=UTF8#textstats">text stats</a>&nbsp;
 such as words per dollar give their customers other ways of exploring 
content.&nbsp; Amazon's recommendation engine&nbsp; is one of the better
 one's I've experienced.&nbsp; (Despite the problems with <a target="_self" href="scabs_breasts_and_coldplay.html">scabs, breasts and&nbsp; Coldplay</a>).<br><br>So
 far, the iTunes alternatives have been mainly hampered by the fact that
 their content won't run on the iPod.&nbsp; Amazon will have that 
problem too, but with their name recognition and a </font ><a target="_self" href="https://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2006/2/9/2822">few antitrust lawsuits</a><font  size="2">, perhaps we'll have a viable alternative to iTunes when we shop for digital music.<br><br></font >

 romance?. Worth checking out.

I've been writing software professionally&nbsp; for about 25 years, 
which makes me a geriatric programmer.&nbsp; For 20 of those 25 years 
I've used <span style="font-weight: bold;">vi</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">vim</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">make</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">ant</span>
 as my main development tools, and I've been very happy with my 
productivity. Vim coupled with ctags and a bit of configuration gives 
you syntax coloring, in-the-editor compiling and quick code 
browsing.&nbsp; It is a very efficient environment.&nbsp; <br><br>Every 
few years a new development environment comes along. I usually kick the 
tires and give the new tool an honest try.&nbsp; The first IDE I tried 
was TurboPascal which was fast and cheap, but it was Pascal ... and 
well,&nbsp; it just didn't take.&nbsp; I also remember Visual Cafe (my 
first Java ide), Eclipse and Netbeans 1 thru 4.&nbsp; <br><br>For the 
last couple of months now, I've been using Netbeans 5.0, and I think 
I've finally been convinced to retire the trusty old VIM as my 
development environment. NB 5.0 does a whole lot of things just right to
 make coding much easier:<br>
<ul>
<li>CVS integration&nbsp; - everything can be done in the IDE, it's the most intuitive source code control integration I've seen</li>
<li>Matisse&nbsp; - It is ultra slick - it is so easy now to create a 
quick gui panel - and the way the generated gui is represented in the 
code (using code folds to hide the code you shouldn't touch) is very 
nice.</li>
<li>Refactoring tools - things that should be easy (like renaming a 
package) now are, no more fighting cvs and&nbsp; manually grepping 
through hundreds of  imports.</li>
<li>Autocomplete - 80% of my trips to the JDK javadocs have been eliminated</li>
<li>Project dependencies - you can manage multiple projects and their dependencies in the ide, makes building much easier.</li>
<li>Ant at the core - uses ant scripts for building so you can build your software without the IDE</li>
<li>Stable - I've never lost a bit of work with nb5<br></li></ul>Still there are a few things that could be better:<br>
<ul>
<li>Startup time ...&nbsp; vi/vim is much faster</li>
<li>Memory usage - after a day of edit / compile /run cycles I tend to 
need to restart netbeans, its heap tends to get large after a while.</li>
<li>The editor is not VI. I don't like having to reach for a mouse to do things.<br></li></ul>After working with Netbeans 5.0 for a few months, I've decided it's a keeper.&nbsp; So Long VI and thanks for all the :wq<br><br><img alt="" src="support_files/5.html"><br>
