For the last few years I've been coaching a <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/">First Lego League team.</a>  In First Lego League, a team of 8 to 10 middle-schoolers build and program a robot using <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/">Lego Mindstorms</a> and, with the robot, compete against other teams to achieve a set of goals.
</p><p>
This coming fall the competition kicks off with the theme of <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/jrobtcs/flg_chal.htm">No Limits</a>. The challenge is to <i>build and program a robot that addresses the specific needs of people who face physical challenges in today's society. </i>.

</p><p> Given that Dean Kamen, the founder of the First Lego League, is also the inventor of the <a href="http://www.independencenow.com/ibot/index.html">wheelchair that climbs stairs</a> I'm guessing that we'll be getting acquainted with <a href="http://www.philohome.com/stairs/ptitgneugneu.htm">Lego stair climbing</a> technologies. It will be fun.

Yesterday, the J2ME Executive Committee voted to approve the Community Review Draft of  <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=113">JSR-113</a> - the next generation of the Java Speech API. SuperDuper!  There are still some issues that need to be dealt with. The three <b>Nay</b> votes were all due to concern over the API size.   Yep, speech is big. Anyway, there are lots of <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=2606">good comments</a> for the expert group to disect over the next month.

I've always appreciated Sun's logo with its four interleaved copies of the word <i>Sun</i>. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">WikiPedia</a>
  Sun's logo, was designed by professor Vaughan Pratt, of Stanford 
University. The initial version of the logo was shown with its sides 
oriented horizontally and vertically, but it was subsequently altered to
 feature the logo appearing to stand on one corner.
</p><p> The logo is an example of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram">Ambigram</a>,
 a calligraphic design that manages to squeeze two different readings 
into the selfsame set of curves.  I first encountered Ambigrams in the 
writings of Douglas Hoffstadter. I eventually found the definitive work 
of Ambigrams called <a href="http://www.scottkim.com/inversions/"> Inversions</a> by Scott Kim. Mr. Kim is a master of this art form.  He maintains an <a href="http://www.scottkim.com/inversions/">online gallery</a> of some of his work. It is worth checking out.

The ambigram is to writing as the fugue is to music.

Last night while driving my daughters home from dance rehearsal in the 
rain, listening to Zeppelin's 'You Shook me', daughter #1 suggests that 
the windshield wipers should be moving in time to the music. I say, "Why
 Not?". There are <a href="https://www.acm.org/sigmm/mm2001/ep/wang/">Beat Detectors</a>
 that can extract the beat from an MP3 file. It is a simple matter of 
extracting the beat and feeding it to the computer that drives the 
wipers. 
</p><p>
During a hard rain, you'd put on a fast song like 'whole lotta love', 
and during a gentle mist, a slow bluesey number like 'since i've been 
loving you' will do the trick.  Ahhh... synchronicity. Sure it may take a
 little extra CPU processing to extract the beats but nowadays people 
seem to have <a href="https://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/06/17/1618215&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=141&amp;tid=188">Plenty of CPU power</a> in their cars.

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>
In Neal Stephensen's <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">'In the Beginning
... Was the Command Line'</a>, Neal argues that the command-line interface
"opens a much more direct and explicit channel from user to machine
than the GUI".  I agree, for most tasks, I find that a 'bash' shell,
a text editor, and the suite of Unix commands is the most efficient set
of tools.   But ... don't try to write a command shell in Java!  
</p><p> 

In Java, it is not possible to perform raw console I/O, only line 
buffered I/O is possible. The user has to hit [return] before your app 
sees what the user typed. This means that interactive command-line 
editing, password input (where the characters typed are not echoed) or <i>curses</i> style apps  are not possible in Java. Without this capability it is impossible
to write good interactive text apps.  You could not write <i>bash</i> 
in Java, you could not write a non-GUI <i>vi</i> or <i>emacs</i>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4050435">Bug
4050435</a> "Improved interactive console I/O (password prompting, line editing)" is number 11 on the list of <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/top25_rfes.do">Top RFEs</a>
 at the
Java Bug Parade. This RFE is to provide an API to give Java the ability 
to
put the console in raw mode, to allow for character by character input
and output to the terminal.  It seems like simple, almost trivial 
functionality to add to the Java platform, and it would allow the 
writing of a whole class of applications.   However,
given that the RFE has been outstanding for <b>Seven Years</b>, it is 
unlikely that we'll be seeing a Java command line in the near future. 
But you can help. This RFE only needs about 25 more votes to move it 
into the top 10 RFEs.  If you think Java console apps are important, add
 your vote to have this RFE fixed.  Seven years is a long time to wait 
for such an important thing.
</p><p>

<i>Update - 12 ours later </i> only 14 votes more to go!

Another shot fired in the <i>"Java vs. C++" </i> war is the <a href="http://www.kano.net/javabench/"> The Java is Faster than C++ and C++ Sucks Unbiased Benchmark</a>.
  Right away, you can tell that this is an unbiased benchmark (because 
it says so right in the title!).  Anyway, this page compares the 
performance of C++ vs. Java for a number of benchmarks (taken from the 
now retired <a href="http://www.bagley.org/%7Edoug/shootout/index2.shtml">Great Computer Language Shootout</a>).  Java does well when compared to C++ in these tests.  
</p><p> I've been around the block enough times to be a bit leary of any performance claims (remember <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/0,39020645,2136537,00.htm">Apple's "fastest PC</a>), nevertheless, there's enough info (including code) on the page to allow anyone to reproduce the numbers.
</p><p> At the bottom of the benchmark page is a set of links to a few 
other sets of Java vs. C or C++ comparisions including a reference to  <a href="http://research.sun.com/techrep/2002/abstract-114.html">FreeTTS - A Performance Case Study</a>,
 a paper written by our speech team here in Sun Labs. This paper 
describes the performance issues we encountered when developing  <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/">FreeTTS</a>.
  I think it is a pretty good representation of the issues involved in 
developing a high-performance Java application along with a comparision 
between a Java and a native-C version of the same application. This 
paper  describes how we ported a native-C synthesizer (Flite) to Java 
(FreeTTS) and how were able to get better performance from our engine.

				<p>
</p><pre>In developing <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4">Sphinx-4</a> (our speech recognizer written in the Java 
programming language), we often are dealing with large graphs that define the
search space.  When debugging the system, we often will want to visualize these
large graphs to ensure that they are constructed properly.  
</pre>
<p>
</p><pre>To do this we use a program called <a href="http://www.aisee.com/">aiSee</a>. 

AiSee is a software package for laying out and displaying graphs. AiSee has
a number of algorithms for laying out different styles of graphs.  There 
are a number of examples on their <a href="http://www.aisee.com/gallery/">Gallery </a> page.
</pre>
<p>
</p><pre>AiSee uses a little language called <b>GDL</b> The <a href="http://www.aisee.com/gdl/nutshell/">Graph Description Language </a>. 

Here's a good <a href="http://www.aisee.com/gdl/syntax.htm">example </a> 
of GDL for a graph that looks like this:
</pre>
<p>
<img src="support_files/g10.gif">
</p><p>
</p><pre>We've instrumented Sphinx-4 to dump out upon request GDL for the important data
structures.  With this we can explore our large data structures using aiSee.  
Here are some examples.
</pre>
<p>
<b> Component Hierarchy </b>
</p><pre>This plot shows the various high level components in a typical Sphinx-4 
configuration and how the components relate to each other:

<b> JSGF Grammar Graph</b>
</p><p>
This is a word graph that represents the simple JSGF Grammar:
</p><pre>public &lt;basicCmd&gt; = &lt;startPolite&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;endPolite&gt;;

&lt;command&gt; = <action> <object>;
&lt;action&gt; = /10/ open |/2/ close |/1/ delete |/1/ move;
&lt;object&gt; = [the | a] (window | file | menu);

&lt;startPolite&gt; = (please | kindly | could you | oh  mighty  computer) *;
&lt;endPolite&gt; = [ please | thanks | thank you ];

				Yesterday was my birthday, so I decided to take a vacation day and 
take a hike in the wonderful White Mountains of New Hampshire.  It was 
supposed to be the hottest day of the year thus far (95 degrees and very
 humid), but instead it was very comfortable 70 degree day, it was a 
super day.
<p>
Marc (my constant hiking companion) and I took the signal ridge trail up <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/whites/carrigain.html"> Mount Carrigain</a> on the south eastern corner of the Pemmigewasset Wilderness.
</p><p>

</p><p>
It was an eight hour hike, 10 miles distance and 3500 feet in elevation.
 Not too bad for a 45 year old.  Of course, since this IS the White 
Mountains it had to rain sometime. For this hike it was for the last 
hour.  I was soaked by the time I finished, but I had a towel and a 
change of clothes waiting for me at the car.  All in all, a great day. 
(That's me in the picture from Signal Ridge on the way to the top).

				The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0470869054/ref=ase_bdaum-20/102-7017884-4688900?v=glance&amp;s=books%22"> Eclipse 2 for Java Developers</a> devotes 3 chapters to writing a 'talking-head' application that uses <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/">FreeTTS</a>

Coincidently, chapter three of this book is titled <i>Project 1 'Duke Speaks'</i>. I think that's a pretty clever title.
