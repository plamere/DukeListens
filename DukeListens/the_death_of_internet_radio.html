				<p>This is a big deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.kurthanson.com/archive/news/030207/index.shtml">RAIN</a> (The Radio and Internet Newsletter) the Copyright Royalty Board has adopted the 'pay per play' rate proposed by <span class="body_regular"><a href="http://www.soundexchange.com/" target="_blank"><b>SoundExchange</b></a>(the digital music royalty collection body created by the <a href="https://www.riaa.com/" target="_blank"><b>RIAA</b></a>). The royalty fees are so high that they will likely drive most of the&nbsp; Internet radio stations (such as our favorite <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a>) right off the air.&nbsp; Bill Goldsmith, the creator of Radio Paradise says:</span></p><blockquote><p><i>For some time, we've suffered with a system where we pay a large chunk
(10%-12%) of our income to the Big 5 record companies - while FM
stations and radio conglomerates like Clear Channel
pay nothing. Now they want even more. In our case, <b>an amount equal to 125% of our income</b>.&nbsp; </i></p></blockquote><p><i></i>This will also likely have a tremendous negative impact on companies like <a href="https://www.pandora.com/">Pandora,</a> that thrive on customized radio streams.&nbsp; The new licensing fees include a <i>per channel</i>
 cost which may mean that each customized radio stream that Pandora 
serves may cost them a $500 minimum.&nbsp; That's $500 for each of their
 many millions of listeners.&nbsp; (UK based last.fm on the other hand, 
may not be affected by this at all).</p><p>An excellent analysis of the 
new rates and their impact on a typical Internet broadcaster (along with
 some really good commentary) can be found at <a href="http://www.save-internet-radio.com/2007/03/02/save-internet-radio/">Save Internet Radio</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/"></a><br></p>

                The RIAA is so far behind, that they didn't even think 
about how to deal with personalized radio stations (like pandora.com).

It will be interesting to see if any station will paying these CRB fees 
for 2006.

Its also interesting to note how much (additional) hatred the RIAA has 
earned with this (<a href="http://digg.com/tech_news/Save_Internet_Radio_from_the_RIAA" rel="nofollow">comments on digg</a>).

							March 5th, 2007
Hello everyone,

My name is DJ Formaldehyde. My wife and I have hosted a show called “A 
Darker Shade of Retro” at www.flashbackalternatives.com for over two 
years. As an internet broadcaster as well as a musician, I need to raise
 awareness about an issue that is very close to my heart. 

As of Friday March 2nd 2007, the Copyright Royalty Board announced new
royalty rates for Internet Radio stations in response to heavy 
petitioning by the Recording Industry Association of America. These 
rates are retroactive to
January of 2006, thus the future of internet radio is seriously 
threatened. Internet radio stations will be subject to much higher 
licensing fees, and these fees are proportional to the amount of 
listeners. One average, every station will have to pay 1.75 cents per 
listener per hour. In other words, a station that has an audience of 500
 listeners will pay roughly $210 per day, or $76,000 per year, which is 
about 10 times more than what stations are paying now. This will force 
most internet stations off the air. It will have a negative impact on 
Bands, Indie labels and Campus Radio Stations as well. This of course, 
raises many questions.

First off, why is it that in the U.S. the body that governs the 
recording industry is allowed to govern or at least influence the rules 
of internet broadcasting. This is direct conflict of interest since in 
most countries, the task of governing broadcasting lies with one 
organization, while the process of collecting royalties on behalf of the
 artists fall to another. (In Canada’s case, the CRTC governs 
broadcasting while Socan represents publishers and artists). One has to 
ask why the RIAA is allowed to have so much power over the legislation 
of the broadcast medium, while at the same time they are able to protect
 their own interests. The argument most often given is that with 
declining CD sales and illegal downloading, other means of collecting 
revenues must be explored. This sort of action however, punishes those 
who are widening the exposure of new artists to potentially new fans and
 prevents it artists from promoting themselves through Internet Radio.

Many Internet radio stations have become instrumental in promoting new 
artists and independent record labels by helping them establish a fan 
base. Artists and labels need to be aware that this avenue of exposure 
is about to become a thing of the past. By imposing these high fees, 
only the high profile broadcasters such as AOL will prevail, and only 
the most mainstream programming will remain available. By making these 
fees retroactive to January 1st of 2006 every broadcaster will be left 
owing an unreasonable and unforeseen about of money to the Copyright 
Royalty Board, which will force most broadcasters into bankruptcy. To 
put things into perspective, popular stations with an average of 1,000 
listeners currently pay about $1,500 to $2,500 per month to stay on the 
air. Now they will owe an additional $12,000 for each for each month 
they were on the air from January 1st of 2006, which is an amount that 
not even the best business plan in world could cover, and as a result, 
most will simply close down. Imagine what would happen your local cable 
company informed you that your rate has retroactively increased from $50
 per month to $500 and you are left owing $5400. How would that even be 
constitutional?

This whole scheme does raise some questions. Why is the RIAA so 
motivated to shut down Internet broadcasting? Could it be due to 
complaints from commercial radio and satellite broadcasters that are 
losing listeners to internet stations that are being run by hobby DJs?  
Could it be due to pressure from record labels worried that it is easy 
to record music onto your computer while listening to an online radio 
station? Either way it seems like the RIAA has deliberately targeted 
internet radio stations in order to force them off the air.

From a personal point of view I can only draw the conclusion that the 
RIAA is trying to downsize the industry as a whole. Since the 
Alternative Revolution in the early 90’s the independent record labels 
have been able to do fairly well. The inception of www.myspace.com has 
enabled artists to promote themselves with ease. All they have to do is 
make a few tracks available for download, and if a music director of any
 station likes what they hear, they can simply include it into their 
stations programming. Where does that leave the RIAA under the old 
rules? They don’t get a cent because they didn’t do any work for it. And
 that is what the RIAA hope to change in my opinion. They want to change
 the rules by taking away any avenue of promotion that does not include 
the major labels, and once again keep the entire industry to themselves.

One of my biggest questions regarding this issue is: What will happen to
 terrestrial radio broadcasters who also stream their normal broadcasts 
on the internet? At the moment the amount of money a terrestrial 
broadcaster pays does not depend on the amount of listeners they have. 
They pay a monthly fee. They are not being punished for being 
successful. So why should the rules be different for Internet 
Broadcasters? At the very least, to make things fair, commercial 
broadcasters should be required to be paying the same rate as Internet 
broadcasters are, if they are streaming their programming on the 
Internet as well. But if that becomes the law, then that would put many 
campus radio stations in jeopardy as well. Their transmitters tend to be
 of low power and they especially benefit from using the Internet to 
reach more listeners. By being forced to pay for streaming Internet 
broadcasts on a “per listener” basis, most campus radio stations will 
have to give up that practice. And since the royalties owing are 
retroactive to January 2006, that would bankrupt most campus radio 
stations as well.

So who knows why the RIAA is going after the very institutions that are 
giving artists a wider audience. Why not go after big businesses that 
are not paying royalties the music that their customers are listening to
 while they are “On Hold”? In that case why not charge larger 
corporations more money as they have more customers on hold at any given
 time? Why not go after illegal Russian download sites that pose as 
legitimate? Why not go after night clubs that aren’t paying they play or
 don’t bother submitting playlists?

The argument of providing a fairer way of sharing royalties for artists 
is a completely invalid one. Artists are not getting their fare share of
 royalties anyway. Random samples of major radio station playlists are 
taken, and payments are calculated on that basis. Club playlists are 
rarely requested and campus radio playlists don’t seem to account for 
much of a difference. Internet broadcasters do submit their playlists 
like terrestrial broadcasters, but the manner in which they affect the 
way that royalties are paid out is minimal, due to their “insignificant 
market share”. Charting artists get the money first. While Internet 
broadcasters tend to exist by filling a void that regular broadcasters 
aren’t filling, the revenue they create for the RIAA is being primarily 
given to those who haven’t earned it in the first place.

Given these facts the days of Internet Radio seem numbered. There are of
 course things that can be done to attempt to revoke these new 
regulations. Regardless of whether you live in the U.S. or not, these 
rulings do affect you. So write as many letters to congress as you can 
in order to force an appeal.

Anyhow, my plea goes out to you all, not only as an internet DJ, but 
also as an artist, to do what you can to keep internet radio on the air 
in the future. It is after all the true Spirit of Radio.

Yours truly,
