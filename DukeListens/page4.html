	<div class="entry-content">
				Most music recommenders use some form of collaborative filtering to 
connect listeners with new music. That's not a surprise, CF works really
 well for popular music (which, of course, is what most people are 
listening to).  But if you are interesting in long tail music, music 
that is unpopular (or perhaps music that is brand new and doesn't have 
any listeners), then you are out of luck A collaborative filtering 
algorithm cannot help you -- CF recommenders rely on the wisdom of the 
crowds, but that leaves them impotent when there are no crowds.  One 
approach to the  problem of dealing with new (or unpopular) content is 
to use a content-based recommender - instead of making recommendations 
based upon who is listening to a song, the recommendations are made 
based on what the song sounds like. 
<p> We've seen a few commercial music recommenders that rely on 
content-based techniques - MusicIP, Echo Nest, Ghanni, One Llama, 
Audiobaba,  Owl,  SoundFlavor and Pandora have all had some aspect of 
content-based recommendation at the core of their systems.  Now there's 
another content-based recommender to add to the list of contenders - 
mufin. <a href="http://beta.mufin.com/"><img src="support_files/_mufin-logo.png" alt="mufin-logo.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" border="0" height="94" width="356"></a>
</p><p>
<a href="http://beta.mufin.com/">Mufin</a> (which stands for <b>Mu</b>sic<b>Fin</b>der) is a content-based recommender that (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/08/mufin-an-automated-music-recommendation-engine-that-actually-works/">according to Techcrunch</a>) is an offshoot of Fraunhofer (the folks who invented the MP3). Given this pedigree, I had very high expectations for Mufin.
</p><p>
</p><h2> The Technology</h2>
From the<a href="http://business.mufin.com/uk/mufin/technology/"> Mufin Technology page</a>: 
<p>
</p><ul><i>mufin uses mathematical extraction of specific details from a
 music title to create an objective desciption of the title’s 
characteristics which is independent of human influences. Using this 
description, songs which are similar to one another can be filtered out 
of a large database.  Rhythmical characteristics (e.g. intensity of the 
rhythm, tempo, percussion in the piece), sound colour, harmonic and 
melodic qualities are weighted differently for the result.
</i>
</ul> 
<h2> My Impressions</h2>
I was lucky enough to get a invitation to the Mufin private beta - so I took it for a spin - here are my impressions.
<p>
<img src="support_files/_mufin-search.png" alt="mufin-search.png" border="0">
</p><p>
The Mufin site is very simple to understand.  It has a classic search 
box where you can search for an artist, album or track.  Since there are
 nearly 5,000,000 tracks in the catalog you are bound to find what you 
are looking for.  I searched for bands like Deerhoof, ELP, The Beatles, 
Hannah Montana, The Feelies, and the Rheostatics.  Mufin had them all.  
Unfortunately, Mufin won't let you play back all of the songs in the 
catalog - some songs can be played all the way through, some you can 
play 30 second excerpts, and some are not playable at all - this is, no 
doubt due to the crazy licensing issues that plague digital music.  
Mufin also lets you purchase tracks from iTunes - (allowing Mufin to 
make some money via referrals).
</p><p>
</p><h2> The Recommendations </h2>
Of course, searching for music is no big deal - what we are interested 
in are the content-based recommendations.   So lets check them out.
<p>
Whenever I try out a new content-based recommender, the first track I usually try is  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_9">Revolution #9 </a>by the Beatles. This is a good way to find out if a recommender is really <a href="ghanni_music.html">a CF recommender trying to pose as a content-based recommender</a>.
  Revolution 9 is so unlike any other Beatles song (or any other Rock or
 Pop song recorded in the 70s)  - that recommendations from a 
content-based recommender will yield very different results than what 
you'd get from a CF recommender.  Using Mufin to find music similar to 
Revolution #9 yielded a rather strange grab bag of music: Some Wagner, 
Engelbert Humperdink, UFO, Gershwin, The Disney Aladin Soundtrack, Frank
 Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald. No 70s pop, which is a good sign, but the
 results seemed to be strongly under the influence of a random number 
generator.  Not a very good start - but since Revolution #9 is not your 
typical track perhaps these results were an aberration.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_muf-rev9.png" alt="muf-rev9.png" border="0">
</p><p>
So I moved on to something a bit more conventional - some power pop with from Weezer. I tried the track 'My Name is Jonas'
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_mufin-weezer.png" alt="mufin-weezer.png" border="0">
</p><p>
These results looked better with tracks by Foreigner, Cell Division, 
Guano Apes, Dream Theater. However, there was also quite a bit of heavy 
metal - Rhapsody, Kamelot, Dio - that didn't really seem to fit to well.
</p><p>
Next up was some cool jazz - Take Five by Dave Brubeck. For similar 
tracks I did get some cool jazz like McCoy Tyner, but also some salsa, 
some crash test dummies, some blues by McCracklin and Louisiana Red 
(good stuff, but not anywhere near the cool jazz and syncopated rhythms 
of Brubeck), some female vocalist/country music by Frances Black, Gospel
 music by the Jackon Southernaires.  Again it seemed like the random 
number generator was working overtime on this set of recommendations.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_muf-takefive.png" alt="muf-takefive.png" border="0">
</p><p>
Next up was Led Zeppelins venerable classic Stairway to Heaven:
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_mufin-sw.png" alt="mufin-sw.png" border="0">
</p><p>
The recommendations included soul music by Aaron Neville, minimalist 
electronica (tubular bells), classical piano (Mussorgsky), easy 
listening (Englebert Humperdink, Paul Anka).  There was no need to 'get 
the led out' of this list.  One has to wonder about a recommender that 
puts Engelbert Humperdink in the same list as Mussorgsky's Pictures at 
an Exhibition.
</p><p>
Finally I tried some classical music - with Beethoven's Fifth symphony.
</p><p><img src="support_files/_muf-beet.png" alt="muf-beet.png" border="0">
</p><p>
These recommendations seem to be much better - the recommendations 
include some more Beethoven, there's Hayden, Handel, Tschaikovksy, 
Mozart, Chopin, Dvorak and a number of classical film scores.
</p><p>
</p><h2> Summmary</h2>
The Mufin folks have done a good job putting together the Mufin site.  
They've indexed an incredible amount of music. The search engine and the
 recommender engine are fast. The site design is clean, and easy to use.
 However, the content-based recommendations provided by Mufin don't fair
 well when compared to the type of recommendations one can get from a CF
 filtering recommender. There is a very high rate of 'clunker' tracks 
that no human would ever recommend based upon the seed track.  For some 
seed tracks, the recommendations seemed no better than shuffle play 
-while for others especially classical, the recommendations seemed to be
 pretty good.
<p> The Mufin team are <a href="http://blog.mufin.com/rollercoaster/2008/10/09/en/">working hard</a>
 to improve their recommendations - I hope they get the kinks out - it 
would be nice to see long tail, content-based recommendation become a 
reality.

				<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">PhD student</span> Last.fm Employee <a href="http://home.mit.bme.hu/%7Enepusz/">Nepusz Tamás</a> has created some nifty and rather intriguing plots of the last.fm artist similarity space at his site: <a href="http://sixdegrees.hu/last.fm/index.html">Reconstructing the structure of the world-wide music scene with last.fm</a>
<img src="support_files/_sixdegrees.png" alt="sixdegrees.png" style="margin: 10px;" border="0">.  
<p>
<i>Update: There's a s<a href="http://livelabs.com/seadragon-ajax/gallery/">uper-zoomable version on the seadragon gallery page</a>. I can't figure out how to directly link to the image ... It is the 5th one from the right.</i>

The plot is created by crawling the similar artist graph of Last.fm 
(starting with Nightwish of all places) using the last.fm audioscrobbler
 webservices.  The artists are arranged on the graph using a DrL graph 
layout algorithm (DrL is a force-directed layout algorithm that works 
with very large data sets. More info about this algorithm can be found 
in <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.14.2764">this paper</a> ).  The nodes in the graph are colored based upon the most frequent tags, while the edges are colored based upon their '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvector_centrality#Betweenness_centrality">betweeness centrality score</a>'. The area of a node in the graph is approximately proportional to the popularity of the artist.
</p><p>
Nepusz has also created an <a href="http://sixdegrees.hu/last.fm/interactive_map.html">interactive map</a>
 that allows you to type in the name of a few artists to see where they 
live on the map  - or you can just enter your last.fm user name and it 
will show you where all your favorite artists are in the world of music.
</p><p>
The layout algorithm does a pretty good job of showing the large scale 
structure of the artist space.  Artists with similar genre tags are well
 clustered. The ability to see where a particular artist is located on 
the map is very nice and the last.fm user integration is particularly 
sweet.   Interesting too, is how the popular artists seem to be 
clustered in the graph. The larger vertices in the red-rock area form a 
very tight line.  This may be an effect of using the Last.fm artist 
similarity which has a popularity bias (the top <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/+similar">10 artists similar to the beatles</a> are all very popular artists).
</p><p>
What I really wish I could do is to use these plots for music discovery -
 I'd like to be able to mouse over a vertex to see what the band is (and
 even be able to listen to the band).  It would be really interesting, 
for instance, to explore the point where the electronic and the rock 
world meets (like in the subsection of the graph shown here on the left -
 what artist is represented by the large orange node?). <img src="support_files/_6d-outlyer.png" alt="6d-outlyer.png" style="float: left; margin: 5px;" border="0" height="84" width="62">
 It'd be interested to see what the outliers are (I wonder what this 
reggae/ska artist is doing near the jazz, as seen in the subgraph on the
 right). <img src="support_files/_6d-outlyer2.png" alt="6d-outlyer2.1.png" style="float: right; margin: 10px;" border="0" height="53" width="75">
 I'd like to be able to zoom in and see some of the finer structure (if I
 zoom in on the Nightwish neighborhood, do I find more finnish, gothic 
metal?).
</p><p>
I'm a sucker for such visualizations, I think they can be a powerful 
tool for helping people to understand and explore a music space, and 
they can reveal relations and structure that are not evident in simple 
lists of similar artists. But creating these visualizations are not 
easy. Without special care they can easily turn into meaningless blobs. 
 Nepusz has done an excellent job finding the right embedding algorithm,
 color and sizing strategy for the data.  I hope he continues to add 
interactivity to his plots. <b>Well done.</b>

				There's a nifty feature on <a href="https://www.apple.com/pro/profiles/slork/?sr=hotnews">Apple's site about Ge Wang and his ChucK programming language for making music</a>.<p><img src="support_files/_D4BEB365-427A-4013-8BF3-899476171DB1.jpg" alt="D4BEB365-427A-4013-8BF3-899476171DB1.jpg" border="0" height="200" width="314">

Ge Wang is a really smart energetic guy.  While at the ISMIR conference 
this year, I sat next to Ge at dinner - he showed me his first iPhone

				Steve and I are taking a road trip tomorrow, driving to the great white north to attend the <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eeckdoug/mmmlw2008/">Montreal Music and Machine Learning Workshop 2008</a> being hosted at the Université de Montréal.  The organizers have posted the <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eeckdoug/mmmlw2008/">schedule</a> that includes eight talks and 10 posters.
<p>
I'll be giving a short talk called <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eeckdoug/mmmlw2008/abstracts/lamere.txt">Stairway to Muskrat Love - If you like Led Zeppelin, you might like Captain &amp; Tennille </a>that
 describes some of the work we've done here in SunLabs (My talk title 
seems to be considerably less formal than the other talks on the 
schedule, sigh).

</p><p>I'm particularly looking forward to the poster session (and not 
just for the wine ad cheese) - there are posters being presented by 
students from UdeM, Columbia, and McGill.  It should be a fun day - and 
hopefully worth the 4AM departure time (3:30AM for Steve!) and the 10 
hours of driving.

There are three main functions:
<ul>
<li>iLikeDisplaySong - displays/plays a single song
</li><li>iLikeSongChooser - search and select a song
</li><li>iLikeDisplayPlaylist - to display/play a playlist
</li></ul>
The terms-of-use is refreshingly simple: <i>We're starting with the hope
 that it simply breaks even. If it turns out to be profitable, we may 
find a way to share revenue with our best developers. If a few 
developers use the system a ton and it costs us too much to support 
them, we may ask them to help us cover the costs. But for now, the 
service is free, please use it and build cool stuff, and if you build 
something that's really popular, we're sure we can all make something 
good come of it.</i>
<p>
The code for displaying a song is straightforward - just include some 
iLike javascript and away you go.  For instance to play a song, use the 
code:
</p><pre> 
&lt;script&gt;
  iLikeDisplaySong({elId: "song1", songName: "roundabout", artistName: "yes"});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
APIs that make it easy for 3rd parties to embed music, like this iLike 
API are going to really help new music exploration and discovery 
companies connect people with music.

Georgia Tech today launches the new Center for Music Technology with 
more than 20 researchers from the arts, sciences and engineering. 
Several interdisciplinary projects already in progress were demonstrated
 today at a launch event for potential collaborators.
</p><p>
There's lots of interesting things to see on at the <a href="http://gtcmt.com/">GTCMT website</a>, including <a href="http://gtcmt.com/?p=958">ZooZBeat
</a></p><p>

<a href="http://transition.turbulence.org/Works/flou/">Flou</a> - 
(pronounced "flew") is not exactly a game; you do fly a ship through 
space, but you cannot shoot anything, score points, or win or lose. The 
focus, rather, is on the soundtrack: as you navigate through a 3D world 
and zoom through objects in space, you add loops and apply effects to an
 ever-evolving musical mix.

</p><p> They are doing some interesting work around music and emotion: <a href="http://gtcmt.com/?p=917">Statistical Learning and Expectation Evoked Emotion</a>, <a href="http://gtcmt.com/?p=913">Emotion in Raag</a>,  and <a href="http://gtcmt.com/?p=922">Basic Auditory Cues for Emotion</a>
</p><p> A number of researchers from GTCMT have been active in the MIMR community including <a href="http://gtcmt.com/?p=61">Parag Chordia</a>, <a href="https://beyondbagofframes.blogspot.com/">Mark Godfrey</a> and<a href="http://gtcmt.com/?p=892"> Alex Rae</a>.

				It's Friday night, and you are headed to the video store to get a 
DVD for the evening's entertainment, but you've already seen "From 
Justin to Kelley" and "Gigli" - so what do you do? Use the <a href="http://www.shawshankr.com/">Shawshankr</a> of course! The <a href="http://www.shawshankr.com/">Shawshankr</a> is a next-generation movie recommender that is extremely easy to use.  Just type in the name of a movie that you like and the <a href="http://www.shawshankr.com/">Shawshankr</a> will give you a top notch, personalized recommendation. It couldn't be easier. Our user studies tell us that the <a href="http://www.shawshankr.com/">Shawshankr</a> recommendations are of high quality, and perhaps more importantly, <i>extremely consistent</i> (and everyone knows how important consistency is in recommendation!).
So if you are looking for a good movie, be sure to give the <a href="http://www.shawshankr.com/">Shawshankr</a> a try.

The Shawshankr was created by my colleague, <a href="http://research.sun.com/people/mybio.php?c=257">Jeff</a> - who deserves all the credit and praise for this wonderful system.</i>

				We made a video of our Music Explaura - a web application that gives
 you transparent, steerable recommendations.  This demo shows how we can
 start from an artist that we like (Jimi Hendrix), and steer the 
recommender toward the aspects of Jimi Hendrix that we like (his guitar 
playing) and away from aspects that we don't like as much (60s 
psychedelia). The resulting recommendations are much closer to our taste
 than the typical recommendations.  Watch the video:

				Recommender startup Matchmine has shut it doors.  CEO Mike Troiano says on the <a href="http://blog.matchmine.com/">Matchmine blog</a>:

<ul><i>Today - more suddenly than anyone would have liked - matchmine 
came to an end. I got word of the decision on Friday, and told the team 
here this morning. We are shutting the company down immediately, though a
 few of us will stick around to try and support our partners through a 
transition, and notify others affected by the closing of our doors. </i></ul>
<p>
This <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2008/10/27/matchmine-flames-out-suddenly/">article fills in the details</a>.
</p><p></p><ul>
<i>The nature of our financing meant that the financial market crisis 
overtook us more abruptly than most,” Troiano writes. “To my team and 
their families, our vendors, network partners and prospects, I can only 
say that I am deeply sorry for the way this comes to a close. And I 
don’t mean ‘press release sorry;’ I mean really, personally sorry.</i>
</ul>
We've had lots of interesting discussions with the Matchmine folks over 
the last year - they are a bunch of smart people - I hope they all find 
good homes.
