		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Social music web sites like last.fm and iLike are all the rage. 
They harness the wisdom of the crowds to make recommendations - using 
the Amazon-esque 'people who listen to X also listen to Y' style of 
recommendations.&nbsp; The core value for these social music sites is 
the taste data that they collect on all of their users.&nbsp; However, 
because this taste data is user submitted, it is fairly easy for users 
to submit fake data.&nbsp; For instance, here's a little applescript 
from <a href="http://dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/itunes41info.php">Doug's Applescripts</a>&nbsp; that sets the playcount of the first selected song in iTunes to 250,000</p><blockquote><pre><span style="color: red;">tell</span> <span style="color: blue;">application</span> "iTunes"<br>	<span style="color: red;">set</span> <span style="color: green;">t</span> <span style="color: red;">to</span> <span style="color: red;">get</span> <span style="color: blue;">item</span> 1 <span style="color: red;">of</span> <span style="color: blue;">selection</span><br>	<span style="color: red;">set</span> <span style="color: blue;">played</span> <span style="color: blue;">count</span> <span style="color: red;">of</span> <span style="color: green;">t</span> <span style="color: red;">to</span> 250000<br><span style="color: red;">end</span> <span style="color: red;">tell</span><br></pre></blockquote><p>Many
 of the social recommender sites will sync up with the iTunes playcount 
data. So all I have to do is select 'Perfect Me', run the script, sync 
up with my favorite social music site and I've become Deerhoof's #1 
fan.&nbsp;&nbsp; People really do this ...&nbsp; last.fm user <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Kikoin/">Kikoin</a> has 'played' Metallica songs over 128,000 times.&nbsp; iLike user <a href="http://ilike.com/user/Shay_K8/most_played_artists">Shay K</a> has 'played' the White Stripes over 472,000 times.&nbsp; Take a look at the playcounts for Shay K's top ten artists:<br></p><blockquote><p>
    
  

  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 472,744 The White Stripes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 337,880 The Beatles<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 337,819 Beastie Boys<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 270,334 Stephen Malkmus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp; 270,211 Tom Petty &amp; The 
Heartbreakers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 256,433 Ween (on tour)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 202,665 The Cure<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 137,006 The Polyphonic Spree<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 135,455 Wilco (on tour)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 135,290 Vince Guaraldi Trio</p></blockquote><p>Adding
 up the playcounts for Shay K's top 30 tracks we get more than 5 million
 total playcounts.&nbsp; At 3 minutes a song, if Shay K listened to 
music 24 hours a day, we get about <i>30 years of continuous music</i>.&nbsp;
 Imagine now, if Shay K's data goes into the iLike music recommender 
unfiltered - Shay K's synthetic taste could dominate the similarity 
model and we'd end up with some rather surprising recommendations like 
"if you like the White Stripes, you may also like the Vince Guaraldi 
Trio".</p><p>If you are going to deploy a 'wisdom of the crowds' music 
recommender you are going to have work hard to separate the real taste 
data from the manufactured taste data,&nbsp; or else you will generate 
bad recommendations.&nbsp; Garbage In - Bad Recommendations out.<br></p><blockquote><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

				<p>Last week I wrote about the trouble with <a href="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/bj%C3%B6rk_vs_bjork_vs_bork.html">resolving artist names</a>. Here's another real-life example of the trouble.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EL-P">El-Producto</a>
 (aka EL-P) is (according to the Wikipedia) an American rapper, producer
 and entrepreneur from NYC who is a major driving force in alternative 
hip hop for over a decade.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.last.fm/music/El-P?q=el-p"> Last.fm recommends</a>
 similar artists like Canibal Ox, Company Flow, Mr. Lif, Aesop Rock, 
Cage and Vast Aire.&nbsp; All reasonable recommendations.&nbsp; <a href="http://musicmobs.com/recommendations/el-p">Musicmobs</a> yields artists like Murs, Cage&nbsp; and Company Flow. Again reasonable.&nbsp; But<a href="http://ilike.com/artist/El-P"> iLike yields recommendations</a>
 like: Yes, Kansas, Genesis and Superior.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are not good
 recommendations. It looks like iLike is confusing EL-P the rapper with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson%2C_Lake_and_Palmer">ELP</a> the prog rock band.<br><br>Lucky
 for many of the music recommender sites&nbsp; that it is really hard to
 objectively evaluate how well a recommender works, otherwise I think 
some of the high profile, well-funded sites would be embarrassed when 
compared to some of the smaller scrappy sites. <br> </p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States"></a></p>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="ilike_beta_launch.html">
Last year I tried out iLike</a> to see how well it worked.&nbsp; I 
didn't like their 'similar artists'&nbsp; recommendations too 
much.&nbsp; I figured it was a cold-start problem.&nbsp; Since they were
 a new site, they didn't have enough data to make good 
recommendations.&nbsp; I tried iLike again this morning to see how well 
they improved after having 6 months of data.&nbsp; I was surprised to 
learn that I was getting the <i><b>exact same&nbsp;</b></i> 
recommendations as I got back in October.&nbsp; It is as if they have 
not updated their similarity data since they have launched.&nbsp; Some 
of these recommendations are horrendous.&nbsp; Type in <a href="http://ilike.com/artist/Emerson%2C+Lake+%26+Palmer">Emerson Lake and Palmer</a> and the related artists are:</p><ul><li>Elmo and Patsy</li><li>Jose Feliciano</li><li>Vince Guaraldi Trio</li><li>Brenda Lee</li><li>Holiday Express</li><li>Bing Crosby</li><li>Burl Ives</li><li>Trans-Siberian Orchestra</li></ul><p>iLike is still thinking that the most distinctive feature of ELP is their one Christmas song.&nbsp; <br><br>Even more telling are the recommendations for <a href="http://ilike.com/artist/Rodrigo+y+Gabriela">Rodrigo y Gabriela</a>.&nbsp;
 Even though Rod and Gab have been played 20,000 times by iLike users, 
iLike can't offer any recommendations at all. My guess is that when they
 built their artist similarity model back in October, Rod and Gab 
weren't on the map yet - so they had no data. But 6 months later Rod and
 Gab are very popular, iLike should have no trouble generating 
recommendations for them.&nbsp; In their FAQ iLike says:</p><blockquote><p><b>How do you pick which artists are "related"?</b> <i>We use computer algorithms that figure this out using the "wisdom of crowds", i.e. "people who
    listen to this artist also listen to these other artists". The more people use the
    <a href="http://alpha1.ilike.com/download">iLike Sidebar for iTunes</a>,
    the better our computer algorithms will get at figuring out which artists are related.</i> </p></blockquote><p>But
 this doesn't seem to be happening.&nbsp; Perhaps iLike doesn't see 
value in generating good recommendations, and just hasn't bothered to 
push all of their social data into their recommendation engine.<br></p>

 takes a Wisdom Of the Crowds approach.&nbsp; Trying to identify a song?
 Upload a clip&nbsp; to iden.tify.us or type in a lyric, or just 
describe the song and let others help identify it. &nbsp; iden.tify.us 
is a brand new site (beta 0.1) with a small number of users, so the term
 'wisdom of the crowds' may be relying on the "two's company three's a 
crowd" definition of 'crowd'.&nbsp;&nbsp; iden.tify.us is trying some 
novel ways to expand their user base. Frequent song identifiers can get 
referral bonuses, and they make rss and podcast feeds available for the 
content, allowing you to take song identification on the road (but would
 you really want to?)<br> </p><p>I don't see this becoming the next 
digg, but it might be popular enough to actually attract the crowd that

				The recent press release from Amazon about their soon to open music 
store indicated that they had deals with 12,000 record labels.&nbsp; 
That seemed to be an incredible number of labels - stretching the bounds
 of believability, it left me wondering how many music labels are there.
 &nbsp; A web search leads to this l<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_record_labels">arge list of record labels</a>
 on the Wikipedia.&nbsp; There's also a pointer to AllRecordLabels that 
claims to have links to 23,000 (!) record labels or net labels.&nbsp; 
That's a whole lotta labels.<br>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Hot off the press.&nbsp; Amazon <a href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070516005337&amp;newsLang=en">has announced</a> that they will be launching a DRM free music store with music from 12,000 labels, including music from EMI.&nbsp; Back in <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/date/20070109">January I wrote</a> why I think Amazon could be a big deal in digital music.&nbsp; Two aspects that Amazon potentially brings to digital music:</p><ul><li><b>Discovery -&nbsp; </b>Amazon's focus on discovery makes Amazon a much
better online bookstore than any other bookstore.&nbsp; They use all sorts
of ways to connect a reader with a book.&nbsp; Collaborative filtering, book
reviews, customer lists,&nbsp; content search,&nbsp; best seller lists , special
deals.&nbsp; These techniques help get their readers deep into the long tail
of books.&nbsp; Discovery is in Amazon's genes.&nbsp; When they start selling
digital music, you can bet that they will have the same focus on
discovery and give the listener new and interesting ways to find music
in the long tail.&nbsp; A listener may come to Amazon to pick up the latest
U2 track, but may find themselves happily downloading a track by an
obscure artist.&nbsp; This is good for the listener - they will will be
exposed to a larger variety of music and this is good for the long tail
artists.</li><li><b>Metadata - </b>Amazon has a great set of web
services built around their data.&nbsp; Using Amazon's web services, one can
get access to book descriptions, book cover images, reviews, pricing
information - just about&nbsp; any piece of data&nbsp; in Amazon's database is
exposed via their web services.&nbsp; Exposing their data in this fashion
places Amazon at the center of the online literary ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any
startup company that wants to be in a business related to books will&nbsp;
use Amazon's API&nbsp; because it is easy, the data is of high quality and
it is free.&nbsp; This is good for the startup, and even better for Amazon
since all of those startups end up sending their customers to Amazon.&nbsp;
Amazon is already a big part of the music ecosystem.&nbsp; They already have
lots of data for music CDs that is available via their web APIs.&nbsp; They
are probably the largest supplier of album art on the web.&nbsp; The Amazon
part number - the ASIN - is used throughout the web as an unambiguous
identifier for an album. Once Amazon starts to sell individual tracks,
I would expect that Amazon will create an ASIN or an equivalent for
each track in their database.&nbsp; This track-level identifier may become
the primary way of identifying tracks in the music world since Amazon
makes it so easy to get all of the information about an item once you
have the ASIN.&nbsp; This could be a key enabler in the next generation of
music - a&nbsp; ubiquitous song ID tied to deep metadata.</li></ul>The 
store is set to open later this year ... I am very interested in seeing 
what this does to the world of digital music and music discovery.<br><p>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Some music highlights from JavaOne 2007:</p><ul><li><b>'Real' bumper music - </b>In
 previous years, the music at the keynotes was canned, non-commercial 
music.&nbsp; The type of music you could buy a license for and play 
forever.&nbsp; I can still remember the trombone solo in one of the 
frequently played tracks.&nbsp; This year, they played 'real' music - 
that is, commercial music - songs by OK Go,&nbsp; U2 w. Mary J. Blige, 
songs that most people would recognize .&nbsp; Same for the tech 
sessions - the real music was nice.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did notice on the 
keynote webcasts, that I've watched, they've replaced the commercial 
music with the canned music, sigh ... such is the state of music 
licensing on the web.</li><li><b><a href="http://www.anon-music.com/">DJ Anon </a></b>- The openining session started with electronic music by DJ Anon - the music set a good vibe for the day.<br></li><li><b>Tech Sessions -&nbsp; </b>There were only two tech session directly related to music: a talk on the fascinating <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/www.jfugue.org">jFugue,</a> and my talk on Search Inside the Music.&nbsp; <br></li><li><b>Mini music bof - </b>A
 bunch of us that have an interest in music and Java went out for dinner
 one evening.&nbsp; Next year, we should have a real BOF around music 
and Java.<br></li><li><b>School of Rock </b>- one of the music 
highlights of JavaOne was during the walk back to the hotel one 
evening.&nbsp; There was a stage set up in the middle of Union Square, 
and a bunch of kids were playing music.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped and 
watched 3 bands play - these kids were remarkable - playing some 
extremely difficult songs (like Zappa).&nbsp; The kids were from the 
School Of Rock. Awesome stuff.<br><br><a href="http://schoolofrock.com/"><img src="support_files/RS06Queen337.html" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a><br></li></ul>

Mike Love <a href="https://mikelove.wordpress.com/2007/05/15/james-vasile-and-music-influence-networks/">posted this on his blog</a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>[James Vasile]&nbsp; proposed separating the recommendation from distribution of the actual
song - either by referencing an audio fingerprint or some other unique
id (CDDB?). Then each listener can choose a hierarchy of how they would
like to find the audio: find the mp3s on the web, last.fm, amazon
samples, purchase the songs, etc. This would involve the creation of
some standardized XML style format for playlists, and we talked about
how <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a> seems like a
good open platform for receiving these playlists and then using a
diversity of networks to find the audio or at least a sample.&nbsp; (I’m
hoping that somehow last.fm, amazon or itunes will make their samples
more portable to benefit from click-through - maybe this is impossible
or unlikely)</i></p></blockquote><p>I replied with this comment, but I'm not sure if it took, so I copied it here because <i>lots of copies keeps stuff safe.</i> <br></p><p>My reply ...</p><p>The
 technologies that you suggest are necessary to promote a music 
recommendation ecosystem are spot on.  We need universal song id and a 
standard playlist format.  The latter already exists. There is a XML 
playlist format called <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/xspf.org">XSPF</a>
 (pronounced 'spiff') that captures all the information needed for 
portable playlists. It is the product of many smart people (including 
Lucas Gonze from <a href="http://webjay.com/">WebJay</a> and Robert Kaye from <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/MusicBrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a>).
  Many folks are working on tools, APIs and players that generate XSPF 
playlists, that play XSPF playlists and resolve XSPF playlists.  I think
 XSPF has the best chance at becoming *the* universal playlist format.  
As for SongID, there are many commercial audio fingerprinting systems 
out there that can derive a unique (or nearly unique) ID just based upon
 the audio.  The problem, however, is that they all cost money to 
license, and because of that no system has become the standard (defacto 
or otherwise).  The <a href="http://www.musicip.com/dns/index.jsp">MusicDNS</a>
 system probably has the best chance, since it is very low cost 
(essentially free for all but the biggest users), and it ties in with 
the public domain music metadata being created by the MusicBrainz folk. 
Still, the problem with a songID system is that unless it is universally
 used, it is not too useful.  Companies like Apple have little incentive
 to use such a system, since they already own the market. They'd rather 
not make it easier for others to work in this space.  My hope has been 
that a company like Amazon would come along and adopt these standard 
formats (you can read more about this in <a href="the_top_five_things_that.html"> this post</a>) and make a&nbsp; recommendation ecosystem possible.  It hasn't happened yet.</p>
