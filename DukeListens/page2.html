		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<a href="http://www.idiomag.com/api/"><img src="support_files/api_title.jpg"></a>
<p>
Last month, <a href="http://www.idiomag.com/">idiomag</a> launched its 
new developer API that gives 3rd parties access to all sorts of music 
related data.  In particular, the API gives you access to artist data 
such as news articles, reviews and interviews, videos, images and MP3s. 
They provide 'similar artist'-style recommendations as well as 
personalized recommendations based on an individual's listening habits 
(they'll base the recommendations on your listening data that they 
hoover from sites like Pandora, Last.fm or iMeem).  They also will give 
you recommendations based upon your APML (attention profile markup 
language).  (I like how they use our <a href="http://tastebroker.org/">TasteBroker</a> as source of APML for their sample documentation).
</p><p> The API is designed rather well. They support 3 types of output:
 'xml', 'json' and 'rss' (and for some methods, 'apml' 'xspf' and 
'foaf') - so parsing the output will be pretty straightforward for 
anyone who's used any kind of web services. The do have a few rather 
funky conventions like  the parameter name artists[]' to indicate 
multiple artists like so:
</p><pre>http://www.idiomag.com/api/recommendation/articles/xml?key=secret&amp;<strong>artists[]</strong>=muse&amp;<strong>artists[]</strong>=radiohead
</pre>
but thats no big deal.  All of their API methods require an application 
key. One beef I have is with the documentation - they don't have any 
clickable examples in the docs - so trying out the API is rather 
laborious - first you have to copy the url prefix, add your secret key, 
add the method arguments and finally the parameters.  <i style="color: green;">Update 2 The Idiomag folks are fixing this ... some of the methods now have clickable link/examples. Woohoo!</i> They should follow the lead of APIs like <a href="https://last.fm/api">Last.fm</a> or <a href="http://developer.echonest.com/">the EchoNest</a>
 and create a demo key that they can use in their docs so that all 
services can have a clickable example. (The gold standard for web api 
documentation is the Flickr services - their '<a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/?method=flickr.tags.getListPhoto">flickr Api Explorer</a>'
 lets you easily try out all aspects of the API from your web browser). 
There was one glitch in the API - any attempt to format output in APML 
triggers an error <b>Fatal error</b>:  Class 'xmlWriter' not found in <b>/var/www/html/app/views/helpers/apml.php</b> on line <b>11</b> - looks like something is misconfigured in the web server. <em style="color: green;">Update: the Idiomag guys have fixed this already </em>
<p>
The API provides 5 types of services: Articles, Artist, User, Tag and Recommendation.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> <strong>articles</strong> - returns recent and featured articles from the Idiomag catalog
</li><li> <strong>artist</strong> - returns all sorts of info about 
artists including related artists, tags, articles, playlists, videos 
images.  The tag coverage seems quite sparse and uneven.  The Beatles 
have only 3 tags (Classic rock, rock and pop) while Aphex Twin has 6 
(electronic, ambient, IDM, experimental, electronica, techno). 
</li><li> <strong>user</strong> - returns info tailored to a specific user - surprisingly, APML is not one of the supported output types for user/info.<em style="color: green;"> Update - APML is supported, it was just an error in the documentation. Fixed already.
</em></li><li> <strong>tag</strong> - returns information about a tag- 
apparently these are not traditional social tags - they seem to come 
from a fixed vocabulary of tags (the <a href="http://www.idiomag.com/api/tags/">link</a>
 that is supposed to give me the list of all tags currently available is
 broken however, so I can't see how big the list is).  The results seem a
 bit unusual. For instance, the first 4 artists returned for the tag 
'rock' are 'Forward, Russia, '10 Years', '12 Stones', '3 Doors down'.  
So perhaps we are getting an alphabetical list (but I don't know how 
'Forward Russia' got to the front of the list).   I would have expected a
 list ordered by tag frequency which should yield something more like: 
the beatles, radiohead, coldplay, oasis.
</li><li> <strong>recommendation</strong> - gives artist 
recommendations, based either on an APML file, an artist list, or my 
listening behavior at one of 10 or so social music sites.
</li></ul>
Lets take a look at the recommendations.  I tried the API with a single artist as a seed to start things off:
<p>
<b>seed: the beatles</b>
</p><ul>
<li> Sting and Edin Karamazov
</li><li> William Shatner
</li><li> The Kinks
</li><li> Elvis
</li><li> The Rolling Stones
</li><li> Led Zeppelin
</li><li> Paul McCartney
</li><li> The Mamas and the Papas
</li><li> The Beach Boys
</li><li> George Harrison
</li></ul>
This is funny list - Sting and Edin Karamazov have been playing 
16th-century Elizebethan music, Shater is, well, Shatner - so for the 
top two recommendations, these certain win on the novelty scale (but 
perhaps fail on the relevant scale), also notable in its absence is John
 Lennon in the top 20 (he does appear paired with  Yoko, but not by 
himself)
<p>
 </p><p>
<b>seed: emerson, lake and palmer</b>
</p><ul>
<li> Rick Wakeman
</li><li> Gentle Giant
</li><li> Atomic Rooster
</li><li> Moody Blues
</li><li> Van der Graaf Generator
</li><li> Asia
</li><li> Aphrodite's Child
</li><li> Kansas
</li><li> Caravan
</li><li> Camel
</li></ul>
That's a pretty reasonable list.
 <p>
<b>seed:deerhoof</b>
</p><ul>
<li> Blonde Redhead
</li><li> Asobi Seksu
</li><li> Odiorne
</li><li> Quickspace
</li><li> The Fiery Frnaces
</li><li> Menomena
</li></ul>
Again, a reasonable list.
 <p>
<b>seed:miles davis</b>
</p><ul>
<li> John Coltrane
</li><li> Miles Davis and Gil Evans
</li><li> Chet Baker
</li><li> Bill Carrothers
</li><li> Charles Mingus
</li><li> Stan Getz
</li></ul>
A totally fine list 
<p>
One of the neat things about Idiomag is that they can suck up my user 
profile from Last.fm and give me recommendations based on my listening 
habits.  However, the recommendations seemed to be a bit skewed to the 
novel side of the spectrum. Of the 20 artists recommended, I recognized 
only 2 (one I know I don't like, the other is already in regular 
rotation) - it would be helpful if Idiomag could offer some explanation 
of why an artist was recommended (such as 'we are recommending wolf eyes
 because their noise rock is similar in style to deerhoof')
</p><p> The catalog of artists seems to be pretty deep - but I did 
notice some omissions. No Yo Yo Ma, no Maynard Ferguson, no Keith 
Fullerton Whitman. 
</p><p>
One shortcoming of the API is that there doesn't seem to be any way to 
resolve ambiguous artists, so if I want recommendations for <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/artist/2996c6a2-215d-4f78-aed6-81a130b04816.html">Prodigy</a> (the rap artist) and not <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/artist/8fb3bbdb-0eee-42d6-aa0c-8b5c2d3efcef.html">Prodigy</a> (the guitarist) or <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/artist/4a4ee089-93b1-4470-af9a-6ff575d32704.html">The Prodigy</a>
 (the UK electronic group), I am out of luck. There's no way to search 
the catalog for near spellings - so if you try to get information for 
'beatles' instead of 'the beatles' you will get no results.  Idiomag 
should adopt the model that last.fm and the Echonest use - to provide an
 artist search api that returns a list of scored matches with an 
associated musicbrainz id, and allow the id to be used in any subsequent
 method calls.
</p><p> 
The API status feedback is also a bit thin - there's no way to tell from
 the API results if there's a problem. For instance, I tried to get 
recommendations based on seed artists Metallica and Yo Yo Ma (hoping to 
get a recommendation for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqUXDdJ3C-c">Apocalypctica</a>)
 - but the resulting recommendations were just the standard set of heavy
 metal bands - no sign of the cello at all.  It took a while before I 
figured out that Yo Yo Ma wasn't factoring into the recommendations 
because Idiomag doesn't know about him.
</p><p>
One last issue, I can't seem to find any terms-of-use for the API that 
tells me how often I can make calls to the API, and whether I can use 
the data for commercial purposes - perhaps the TOS is hidden somewhere. 
But before I would consider using the API, I would really like to know 
what the rules of the road are. 

</p><p><i style="color: green;">Update 3 - idiomag has now published their <a href="http://www.idiomag.com/files/releases/idiomag_api_terms.pdf">terms-of-use</a>
 It looks very  similar (to my non-lawyerly eyes) to the Last.fm terms -
 free non-commercial use, commercial use is OK, but if you start making 
insane amounts of money, idiomag may start charging you for the service</i></p><p>
Despite a few quibbles, I like the Idiomag API - it puts lots of 
interesting data in the hands of the developer, much of it is data that 
would be hard to come by without paying lots of money.  Given the large 
number of music-related startups (<a href="http://musically.com/blog/2008/12/17/200-digital-music-startups-from-2008/">here's 200 that started just last year alone</a>) finding a way to help all of these companies provide context for their users about music seems like a good idea.
</p><p>
<em style="color: green;">Update - the Idiomag folk sure are responsive.  I posted this to my blog, went to lunch, came back, killed some <a href="http://www.l4d.com/">zombies</a>,
 and then checked my comments here to find that they've already fixed a 
number of the issues that I pointed out.  Looks like they really care 
about what they are doing.  I like that.</em>

				I've been enjoying all of the year-end 'best of' lists. My favorite 
so far has been the Hype Machine Music Blog Zeitgeist.  Especially since
 it is so easy to listen to them:
<p>
<a href="https://hypem.com/zeitgeist/2008"><img src="support_files/zeitgeist-2008-radio.gif" style="border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(159, 169, 172); border-width: 1px 1px 0pt;"></a><br><object height="110" width="452"><param name="movie" value="http://media.imeem.com/m/81rAYqRBky/aus=false/"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/page2_files/a.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" flashvars="headerColor=85c441&amp;autoShuffle=false&amp;r=web&amp;isPrimary=true&amp;primaryColor=85c441&amp;pm=st&amp;secondaryColor=85c441&amp;linkColor=5e5f61&amp;autoStart=false" height="110" width="452"></object>
</p><p>
I've also been enjoying the <a href="http://thepitchfork500.com/">Pitchfork 500</a> - which is a list of the greatest songs since 1977 (the year I graduated from High School).  <a href="http://thepitchfork500.com/"><img src="support_files/book_cover.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a> This list is a bit harder to listen to than the Hype Machine lists - but I've been building up a Spotify playlist - the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/plamere/playlist/5D3XapuqytRAWVIirdhOgC">pitchfork500 on spotify</a>: (I'm only up to 1979), but if you are a spotify listener feel free to listen.  The song list is posted on <a href="https://fromclosertonear.blogspot.com/2008/11/pitchfork-500-our-guide-to-greatest.html">from closer to near</a>
 but you really will want to read the full book, each song has a 2 or 3 
paragraph description of why the song was picked, why it was 
influential, where it fits in the evolving genre hierarchy.

				Here's a <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Full+Transcript+of+Last+Weeks+Lastfm+Interview/article13836.htm">nifty interview of RJ of last.fm</a>
 by Tom Corelis.  Tom asked all the questions that I would have asked.  
 Good job Tom.  Here's what RJ had to say about Sun Hardware:
<p><cite> A few years ago we were buying from a local supplier here, and
 over the years it became more important to us to get really power 
efficient equipment, because at the data centers in London and the UK 
power is a real premium; it was hard to get enough power. So we started 
looking around for machines that were more tailored to low-powered 
stuff.
So we have a mix of different suppliers but right now we’re buying quite
 a lot from Sun. We just got some new low-power blades that we’ve put in
 to do web serving, and our main database – with which we use PostgreSQL
 – is also on Sun hardware, for example. So yeah, we’ve been getting 
some good stuff from them. Sun seems to make a good range of servers 
that are quite conscious on the power requirements, and are quite good 
about giving you the spec about how much power they’re going to draw.</cite>
</p><p>
And Java
</p><p>
<cite>We actually do a lot of our storage and processing in Hadoop, 
which is a framework based on a paper that Google released on the same 
subject. So, that’s actually a distributed computing framework written 
in Java.</cite>

 is a site with a goal of doing for video what Last.fm and iLike do for 
music. ffwd uses collaborative filtering to create video channels that 
are customized for a user.
<p>
This week I received an email from ffwd where they excitedly claimed to 
have some new recommendations for me, including this set of channels 
that I should check out:
<img src="support_files/_ffwd-2.png" alt="ffwd-2.png" border="0">
</p><p>
Two of these seem to be rather general: Recommendations for 'business' 
and 'tv show' would be like the local convenience store recommending 
that I might want to buy some milk and bread. However, it is the third 
recommendation, the 'panties' channel that caught my eye, so to speak.  
 I didn't recall doing anything on ffwd that would trigger an 'adult' 
recommendation, so this particular recommendation was a puzzler.   I 
checked out my history on ffwd to see what they know about me to see if I
 could figure out why they gave me this particular recommendation. It 
turns out, ffwd knows only a little bit about me - I rated a few shows 
last year:</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_ffwd-taste.png" alt="ffwd-taste.png" border="0" height="231" width="335">
</p><p> Its just typical nerd TV - nothing that should trigger a 
recommendation for a tour of the nether regions.  More than likely, 
ffwd's collaborative filtering algorithm is just not dealing with sparse
 data very well, causing it to make freakomendations.  Unfortunately for
 ffwd, these aren't just bad recommendations, they are likely to be 
offensive to some.
</p><p>
Sure enough, a few days later, I had this email in my inbox:

</p><blockquote><p>
Subject: <strong>apology from the ceo</strong>
</p><p>
Dear plamere,
</p><p>
On behalf of the ffwd team, I apologize if our recent email 
recommendations didn't make sense, or worse, offended you. We are 
testing a new channel recommendation system and may have put it into 
service prematurely.
</p><p>
Most subscribers found the suggestions useful, but if you didn't, please
 be patient as we work out the kinks and simply respond honestly to the 
recommendations. By ignoring the mistakes, and clicking on the relevant 
suggestions, you will improve the system for you and all other viewers.
</p><p>
Again I apologize for any offensive recommendations and appreciate your patience as we improve our system.
</p><p>
Happy New Year!
</p><p>
Patrick<br>
CEO, ffwd
</p><p></p></blockquote>
And so it seems, I was not the only one of ffwd's users who received 
such an recommendation.  As corporate apologies go, this is not a bad 
one, but I don't like this bit "Most subscribers found the suggestions 
useful, but if you didn't, please be patient...". This seems to imply 
that if I took offense, it is really my fault, not ffwd's, since most of
 the ffwd subscribers didn't seem to be offended. If you are going to 
apologize, just do it, don't waffle or weasel about it.

Today on the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/blog/archives/2008/12/18/spotify-scrobbles/">Spotify blog</a>,
 Andreas announced that Spotify now supports scrobbling to Last.fm. Once
 you set it up,all of your Spotify plays will be automatically 
scrobbled.
<p><img src="support_files/_scrobspot2.png" alt="scrobspot2.png" border="0" width="500">
</p><p>
Setting this up just takes a couple of seconds in the Spotify preferences:

</p><p>
Andreas also points out this <a href="http://emil.hesslow.se/spotify/spotify__lastfm.user.js">nifty Greasemonkey script</a>
 that lets you play the Last.fm site in Spotify. Here's an example, the 
greasemonky script has added the green music notes to my 'Friends 
listening now' section.  When I click on the green note, spotify opens, 
ready to play the artist, album or track. Totally cool.
