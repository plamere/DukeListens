				<em>The story so far - this is an <a href="open_research.html">experiment in 'open research'</a> - I'm going to blog my research on a particular topic.  In this post, I'm outlining the high level goals for the project.</em>
 
<h2>Executive Summary
</h2>
Find better ways to exploit the information that are contained in social
 tags, especially social tags that are applied to music, in order to 
provide tools to allow an individual to explore a complex space. 

<h2>Details
</h2>Most music recommendations are of the form - 'here's a set of 
artists or tracks that you might like', or 'if you like "weezer" you 
might like "cake".  They don't offer any reasoning behind the 
recommendation.  These types of recommendations may be appropriate if 
you are shopping for music at AmazonMp3 or iTunes, but it really is a 
horrible way to go about exploring for new music.
<p>

</p><p>

 <img src="support_files/_itunesonece.png" alt="itunesonece.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" border="0">

Music is a very rich space.  There are hundreds or thousands of 
overlapping genre and subgenre.  The meaning of a genre changes overtime
 ("Pop" of 2000 is very different from "Pop" of 1970).  Some artists 
define their own genre, other artists span many genres.  There's no 
single "correct" taxonomy of genres - experts don't even agree on the 
most basic questions about genre such as where does 'pop' end and 'rock'
 begin.    Genre is complex - and yet it is only one axis of this 
complex music space. There is also mood, era, lyrics, artist influence, 
popularity and on and on.

Ultimately, I'd like to build a discovery tool that will allow a user to
 easily explore a rich space such as music. Unlike a traditional 
recommender that is tailored for a music shopper, this discovery tool 
would be tailored to someone who is exploring  for the enjoyment of 
discovery.  <a href="http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/">Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music </a>is an excellent example of the type of interface I am interested in building.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_iskurs.png"><img src="support_files/_iskurs.png" alt="iskurs.png" style="width: 500px;" border="0">
</a>
</p><p>

In this one interface is captured the  a very rich view of the world of 
electronic music.  There is decade information, high level genre, 
subgenres, genre dependencies, with examples from multiple artists for 
each genre along with  reviews of the artist or genre.   I'd like to be 
able to build an interface similar to Ishkur's automatically using data 
that is available from sites like Musicbrainz, Last.fm and All Music.

A first step toward this goal is to be able to find information about 
how various genres and sub-genres overlap.   Professionally curated 
genre hierarchies such as what you'll find at All Music, Mp3.com, Amazon
 or iTunes, tend to be small and flat and don't show any kind of 
overlap.  The genre hierarchy embedded in the wikipedia is richer, but 
still doesn't show how the various genres overlap.

For this first step I want to build a rich representation of the genre 
space automatically from data mined from the web. This rich 
representation  includes:

</p><ul><li>Identifying the set of genres and subgenres that people actually use.  (i.e. is 'Brutal Death Metal' really a genre?).</li>

<li>Distinguish genres from other types of music descriptions such as mood, locale</li>

<li>Identify overlaps in genre (how much if at all does 'emo' overlap with 'punk'?, Is 'alternative' just a new name for 'rock'?)</li>

<li>Create a hierarchy of genre.   Hierarchies are a natural way to 
explore a space - A hierarchy allows an explorer to start from with the 
general and move to the specific.  The hierarchy may be a mono- or a 
poly- hierarchy.</li>

<li>Identify synonyms (Are 'hip hop', 'hip-hop' and 'rap' identical?)</li>

<li>Disambiguate terms (Does 'progressive' mean the same when it is 
applied to 'progressive rock', 'progressive jazz', and 'progressive 
metal'?)</li>

<li>Identify changes in genre meaning over time (Is 1960s 'Ska' the same as 1980s 'Ska'?)</li>

<li>For each genre, what are good exemplar artists/tracks for the genre? Are tracks from popular artists better exemplars?
</li>
</ul>
I want to build this rich representation of genre from data mined from 
the web, without any human intervention, so that as the genre space 
evolves overtime, this genre map will automatically evolve as well.  

I've done some early experiments generating genre mono-hierarchies from 
Last.fm artist tags with promising results.  (<a href="metal.html">See this post</a>).
  However, there is much work to be done to turn that experiment into a 
real system that that can take a big bucket of social tags, separate the
 wheat from the chaff, and turn them into a representation that can 
guide visualization and exploration of the music space.
<p>
<a href="http://support_files/_tinymetal.png"><img src="support_files/_tinymetal.png" alt="tinymetal.png" style="width: 600px;" border="0"></a></p><p>
Next steps - we need to do some background reading, in particular we need to explore a number of  areas:
</p><p>
</p><ul><li>Music seeking behaviors - to understand better how having a 
rich representation of genre might be used to enhance music discovery 
(transparency, play)</li>
<li> Genre Hierarchy - explore the issues involved in trying  to represent genre in hierarchies or overlapping graphs</li>
<li>Text techniques - we will need lots of text mojo here (disambiguation, clustering, latent semantic analysis, etc.)</li>
<li>Evaluation -  we need some way of evaluating our results</li>
<li>Visualization - how do we visualize a complex, overlapping, polyhierarchy?</li></ul>
<p>
I am interested in all kinds of feedback. A big goal for me with this 
'open research' is to get early feedback.  Likewise, suggestions for 
background reading on the aforementioned topics (or any others that seem
 relevant will be helpful).  In a future post, I'll put together the 
reading list for anyone that wants to follow along.

<p>Some helpful social tags for genres could be those from Wikipedia and
 LyricWiki which themselves form an interesting graph.  The 
categorization in MediaWiki (which powers both sites) doesn't force the 
graph to be strictly hierarchical, so it may provide a bit of what

<p>One of my frustrations with music recommendations systems is the 
potentially unsolvable problem of what *doesn't* get recommended.  It's 
exasperating to hear a song on conventional radio that hasn't been 
suggested by any of the Internet music sites i frequent.  My (completely
 unsupported) conclusion from this is that connections that look 
significant to experts and/or machine learning are not always the 
connections that account for quirks in individual taste.</p>


<p>I think it'd be cool to have the sort of tool that you envision, that
 finds connections between music and explains the connections.  But it'd
 also be nice to have a system where i could define the reasons why i 
connect tracks or artists (somber mood, humorous lyrics, 
personally-defined genre connection) and use that as a rule or dimension
 for discovery.  As if the problem weren't already hard enough :-)</p>

<p>It sounds like some of the methodologies in the color name survey 
might be applicable. It suggests that what you are trying to do is in 
fact doable. see <a href="http://infosthetics.com/archives/2008/03/color_name_survey.html" rel="nofollow">http://infosthetics.com/archives/2008/03/color_name_survey.html</a></p>

<p>Paul, some quick thoughts from sunny Vienna:</p>


<p>- Genre: Personally I consider genre to be a very fuzzy concept. I'd 
argue death country [1] and Finnish metal [2] are genres. I've heard 
people talk about how they consider The Beatles to be a genre. It might 
help if you define what "genre" means in your experiments. As far as I 
know there is no specific generally excepted definition of what genre 
means in music.</p>


<p>[1] <a href="https://www.last.fm/tag/death%20country" rel="nofollow">http://www.last.fm/tag/death%20country</a><br>
[2] <a href="https://www.last.fm/tag/finnish%20metal" rel="nofollow">http://www.last.fm/tag/finnish%20metal</a></p>


<p>- Genre hierarchy: You mention Ishkur's guide as example. Ishkur uses
 two approaches to create fuzzy hierarchical graphs. He briefly 
structures genres by similarity hierarchically on the first level. He 
uses a small set of broad and overlapping genres (house, trance, ...). 
Beyond that sub-genres are organized on a time line with connecting 
lines showing influences between sub-genres. I believe the "influenced 
by" hierarchy is very interesting. I think his tool very clearly shows 
the limitations of both approaches to structure music hierarchically. 
Structuring genres hierarchically as subsets (metal -&gt; heavy metal) 
only makes sense on a broad level, and even then there is a lot of 
overlap. Structuring genres in terms of "influenced by" is becoming 
increasingly harder. Ishkur's guide gets very messy in the 90s+... and 
it's going to be even messier in the future. Almost everything is 
influencing everything in today's information age. Artists are gathering
 their inspirations from everywhere, and the number of genres seems to 
be growing exponentially... only bound by the growing number of distinct
 pieces of music. </p>


<p>- Application: I think it might be a good idea to be more specific 
about the intended application. I think Ishkur's guide is primarily 
designed as a tool to understand the complex variations of electronic 
music and how different sub-genres evolved and are connected. Btw, an 
important part of his tool are the funny comments he makes about 
different genres (something no computer could come up with). Anyway, to 
be more specific, I don't think Ishkur or the users of his tool consider
 it to be a music recommendation tool. I think it helps to be more 
specific about the targeted application because there might be some 
shortcuts you could take. For example, for a recommendation tool you 
might not necessarily need to define what a genre is or what influenced 
each genre.</p>

<p>@sean - thanks for the info - I didn't realize that LyricWiki was 
also capturing genre info - very helpful.  It is interesting to see in 
Wikipedia how the genres generated from the MediaWiki categorization 
fields differ from the infobox genres.</p>


<p>@mike - I wonder if the missing connections that you describe are 
symptoms of the coldstart problems.  The DJs can find newer music faster
 than the collaborative filters can. I like your idea of letting the 
user define the connections.</p>


<p>@brian - I particularly like the sheep drawing experiment. <a href="http://www.thesheepmarket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesheepmarket.com/</a> </p>

<p>@elias - thanks for the comments - hope you are enjoying Vienna.  I have fond memories of the Opera and the schnitzel.  </p>


<p>I agree that genre is hard - so some definition of what we mean by 
genre will be important.  Hopefully, we'll be able to tease out a 
reasonable definition from the background reading on genre. Certainly 
quite a bit has been written about the issues around genre and the 
problems of creating genre taxonomies.</p>


<p>Again, I agree with your observations about the increasing 
complexities, as we try to consider hierarchies, influence, how genres 
change over time, how artists fit (or don't fit) into particular genres.
  But we have big computers so I'm sure we can figure  it all out, after
 that it is just a user interface issue ;)</p>


<p>Agreed - Ishkurs's guide is meant to be a way of exploring electronic
 music.  There are lots of aspects of Ishkur's that I like. Indeed, I 
think the snarky editorial comments are fun. They remind the user that 
there's a real human behind the data. Dealing with the complexities of 
the data are a big challenge, and as you point out, the complexities 
will only increase.  I think that is a strong argument for a tool that 
will help navigate the space.  Finding a way to present this data to a 
user in a way that is useful will be a big challenge - and this is not 
my expertise. But there are folks who think hard about this type of 
problem who can hopefully help out.  So for a first step, I'd like to 
build the data set that could be used to build an Ishkurs.  Once we have
 this data, and a method for generating it, we (or others) can build the
 interface.</p>


<p>I agree that Ishkur's is not a music recommendation tool - I consider
 it to be a genre exploration tool.  I do think that for a certain class
 of highly engaged music listeners a discovery tool similar to Ishkur's 
that allows the listener to explore all of music in the same fashion 
would be extremely helpful.  </p>


<p>As for the shortcuts, I understand your point - a general music 
similarity function can simplify navigation and exploration of the music
 space without going through the effort of trying to figure out what 
micro-genres each track belongs to. However, I personally like to learn 
about these genres - it makes it easier to talk to other humans about 
the music if you can talk at a genre level, and I think it is just fun 
to figure out the differences between thrash metal and speed metal. But I
 realize you were just using genre as an example of a shortcut - I take 
your point.</p>


<p>So to sum up - for a first step, I want to be able to build a model 
of music that shows hierarchy, overlap and influence  at a 'genre' level
 (where 'genre' is still to be defined), as well as exemplar 
artists/tracks for the various 'genre'.</p>


<p>Thanks for the feedback - just the sort of feedback  I was hoping to get.</p>

<p>Sounds like a fascinating project. I wonder if you're focusing down 
on the right question though? Given your exec summary, it's not obvious 
that genres should be the primary avenue for exploration. As you 
eloquently point out, genre is only one axis of the complex music space.
 Given the ability of social tagging and other discovery and navigation 
technologies to build and exploit data around some of those other axes, 
there's an argument that genres may steeply decline in importance. 
Genres are important if they are the only way to classify music - it's a
 problem if I don't know whether to look in Pop or Rock in the record 
shop. But if we can assemble a rich set of metadata based on mood, 
period, influence etc, genres start to look like an increasingly blunt 
instrument and the inevitable arguments over correct classification 
pretty academic. </p>


<p>Mood, period and influence (as well as geography, tempo etc) also 
routinely turn up in last.fm tags (I've always been a little surprised 
at the prevalence of genre in  last.fm tags, given it's one of the least
 interesting and useful things to add to the conversation about music). 
Not to mention the amazing work that Pandora and the Music Genome 
Project have done to analyse musical features manually. Why not include 
all of these attributes in your model alongside genres?</p>
