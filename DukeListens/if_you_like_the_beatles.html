			<h2>If you like The Beatles ... a music survey</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In a few weeks, I'll be presenting (along with Oscar Celma), a<a href="http://ismir2007.ismir.net/tutorials.html#tut2"> music recommendation tutorial</a> at <a href="http://ismir2007.ismir.net/index.html">ISMIR 2007</a>.&nbsp;
 As part of this tutorial, Oscar and I will be presenting various 
evaluations of commercial and academic music recommenders.&nbsp; There 
are lots of ways to evaluate recommender systems, but when you get right
 down to it, probably the best way is to ask people what they think 
about them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so... we are conducting a survey and we hope
 that <font color="#000000"><b>you</b></font> will participate.&nbsp; 
The survey is very simple:&nbsp; you are asked to rate the quality 
of&nbsp; recommendations that are of the form "If you like The Beatles 
you might like XXX".&nbsp; The&nbsp; survey will take less than 10 
minutes to complete. If you are interested, then </p><p align="center"><a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/WebSurvey/survey.html"><font size="5">Take the survey</font></a><br></p><p>The
 results of the survey will be used to rank various recommendations 
generated by commercial,&nbsp; and academic recommender systems, as well
 as recommendations generated by professional music 
critics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surveys for recommendations based on other 
seed artists will be coming soon.</p><p>We are hoping to get 100s of 
replies so feel free to tell others about the survey. I shall be posting
 results after the conference at the end of the month.</p><p><i>Update: Well, it turns out using the 'mailto:'</i>&nbsp; <i>on
 a form post is notoriously unreliable, so I spent a few hours this 
morning fixing it, so now things should work quite a bit better.</i><br></p>

<p>Paul, I don't think the Beatles are a good choice to evaluate 
recommender systems. (1) The main target group for music recommendations
 listens to more contemporary music. Why not try something more 
realistic like Deerhoof? (2) The Beatles produced such a broad range of 
music. The different songs have very different styles. I wouldn't be 
surprised if any recommendation not from the same time period would be 
considered a poor recommendation, even if there is a Beatles song that 
sounds almost identical. (3) Furthermore, everyone likes the Beatles. 
For example, I really like the Beatles, but I'm not into most of the 
music that gets played on Pandora similar artist radio for the Beatles 
(or shows up in the Last.fm list of similar artists).</p>

<p>Indeed, you are exactly right.  I have a collection of seed artists 
that I intend to include in the survey.  I started with the 'Beatles' 
since I didn't want to overwhelm people .. but perhaps that was a 
mistake.  Anyway, look for more surveys using seed artists: Miles Davis,
 Emerson Lake and Palmer, Deerhoof and Arcade fire.</p>

<p>Paul, I am not sure what you are looking to use this survey data for?
 I am sure you have a specific purpose but on a surface reading of the 
post it does not seem to make sense?</p>


<p>As Elias points out matching by Artist is very often irrelevant to 
music and so makes for a very poor set of data for evaluating "music" 
recommendations (Elenor Rigby has little in common, musically, with 
Helter Skelter). A look at last.fm's artist recommendations for the 
Beatles, for example, lists bands whose similarity is more to do with 
era and fashion that music per se. I know from communications with 
Pandora that they feel that music needs to be in the same era to be 
similar which others would disagree with. Now of course a great many 
users like these approaches, but it is not the same thing as 
recommendation based on a piece of music (which is my bias).</p>


<p>Now I know this must all be very basic, common knowledge in the MIR 
community which is why I am curious as to why you would want to use this
 type of evaluation? I am sure I am missing something glaringly obvious 
so I would appreciate it if you could give us some more details about 
what you are thinking?</p>
