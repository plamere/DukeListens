				<em>The story so far - this is an <a href="open_research.html">experiment in 'open research'</a> - I'm going to blog my research on a particular topic.  In this post, I'm outlining the high level goals for the project.</em>
 
<h2>Executive Summary
</h2>
Find better ways to exploit the information that are contained in social
 tags, especially social tags that are applied to music, in order to 
provide tools to allow an individual to explore a complex space. 

<h2>Details
</h2>Most music recommendations are of the form - 'here's a set of 
artists or tracks that you might like', or 'if you like "weezer" you 
might like "cake".  They don't offer any reasoning behind the 
recommendation.  These types of recommendations may be appropriate if 
you are shopping for music at AmazonMp3 or iTunes, but it really is a 
horrible way to go about exploring for new music.
<p>

</p><p>

 <img src="support_files/_itunesonece.png" alt="itunesonece.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" border="0">

Music is a very rich space.  There are hundreds or thousands of 
overlapping genre and subgenre.  The meaning of a genre changes overtime
 ("Pop" of 2000 is very different from "Pop" of 1970).  Some artists 
define their own genre, other artists span many genres.  There's no 
single "correct" taxonomy of genres - experts don't even agree on the 
most basic questions about genre such as where does 'pop' end and 'rock'
 begin.    Genre is complex - and yet it is only one axis of this 
complex music space. There is also mood, era, lyrics, artist influence, 
popularity and on and on.

Ultimately, I'd like to build a discovery tool that will allow a user to
 easily explore a rich space such as music. Unlike a traditional 
recommender that is tailored for a music shopper, this discovery tool 
would be tailored to someone who is exploring  for the enjoyment of 
discovery.  <a href="http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/">Ishkur's Guide to Electronic Music </a>is an excellent example of the type of interface I am interested in building.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_iskurs.png"><img src="support_files/_iskurs.png" alt="iskurs.png" style="width: 500px;" border="0">
</a>
</p><p>

In this one interface is captured the  a very rich view of the world of 
electronic music.  There is decade information, high level genre, 
subgenres, genre dependencies, with examples from multiple artists for 
each genre along with  reviews of the artist or genre.   I'd like to be 
able to build an interface similar to Ishkur's automatically using data 
that is available from sites like Musicbrainz, Last.fm and All Music.

A first step toward this goal is to be able to find information about 
how various genres and sub-genres overlap.   Professionally curated 
genre hierarchies such as what you'll find at All Music, Mp3.com, Amazon
 or iTunes, tend to be small and flat and don't show any kind of 
overlap.  The genre hierarchy embedded in the wikipedia is richer, but 
still doesn't show how the various genres overlap.

For this first step I want to build a rich representation of the genre 
space automatically from data mined from the web. This rich 
representation  includes:

</p><ul><li>Identifying the set of genres and subgenres that people actually use.  (i.e. is 'Brutal Death Metal' really a genre?).</li>

<li>Distinguish genres from other types of music descriptions such as mood, locale</li>

<li>Identify overlaps in genre (how much if at all does 'emo' overlap with 'punk'?, Is 'alternative' just a new name for 'rock'?)</li>

<li>Create a hierarchy of genre.   Hierarchies are a natural way to 
explore a space - A hierarchy allows an explorer to start from with the 
general and move to the specific.  The hierarchy may be a mono- or a 
poly- hierarchy.</li>

<li>Identify synonyms (Are 'hip hop', 'hip-hop' and 'rap' identical?)</li>

<li>Disambiguate terms (Does 'progressive' mean the same when it is 
applied to 'progressive rock', 'progressive jazz', and 'progressive 
metal'?)</li>

<li>Identify changes in genre meaning over time (Is 1960s 'Ska' the same as 1980s 'Ska'?)</li>

<li>For each genre, what are good exemplar artists/tracks for the genre? Are tracks from popular artists better exemplars?
</li>
</ul>
I want to build this rich representation of genre from data mined from 
the web, without any human intervention, so that as the genre space 
evolves overtime, this genre map will automatically evolve as well.  

I've done some early experiments generating genre mono-hierarchies from 
Last.fm artist tags with promising results.  (<a href="metal.html">See this post</a>).
  However, there is much work to be done to turn that experiment into a 
real system that that can take a big bucket of social tags, separate the
 wheat from the chaff, and turn them into a representation that can 
guide visualization and exploration of the music space.
<p>
<a href="http://support_files/_tinymetal.png"><img src="support_files/_tinymetal.png" alt="tinymetal.png" style="width: 600px;" border="0"></a></p><p>
Next steps - we need to do some background reading, in particular we need to explore a number of  areas:
</p><p>
</p><ul><li>Music seeking behaviors - to understand better how having a 
rich representation of genre might be used to enhance music discovery 
(transparency, play)</li>
<li> Genre Hierarchy - explore the issues involved in trying  to represent genre in hierarchies or overlapping graphs</li>
<li>Text techniques - we will need lots of text mojo here (disambiguation, clustering, latent semantic analysis, etc.)</li>
<li>Evaluation -  we need some way of evaluating our results</li>
<li>Visualization - how do we visualize a complex, overlapping, polyhierarchy?</li></ul>
<p>
I am interested in all kinds of feedback. A big goal for me with this 
'open research' is to get early feedback.  Likewise, suggestions for 
background reading on the aforementioned topics (or any others that seem
 relevant will be helpful).  In a future post, I'll put together the 
reading list for anyone that wants to follow along.

				It is paper review time.  I'm on the program committee for a few 
conferences so I've been reading and reviewing a number of papers.  
Similarly, I have a couple of submissions that are out for review.  The 
paper review process is really quite interesting.   I send the fruits of
 my hard labor off to some anonymous judges, that  spend some unknown 
amount of time reviewing, commenting and evaluating it and ultimately 
recommending that my work be accepted or rejected.  This peer review 
process is a critical part of the research process - reviewers can find 
flaws in thinking or in methodology. They can point out overlapping 
previous work, They can suggest areas for improvement or even ways to 
extend the research to new areas.  The downside to the peer review 
process is that all of this critical input comes at the end of the 
process, when you are finally ready to publish.  Its never a good day 
when a reviewer points out a serious flaw in your paper ("paper should 
site work by smith that performed identical experiments with better 
results in 1968").
<p>
One way to mitigate this problem is to get early feedback from 
colleagues and peers.  These colleagues can act as earlier reviewers who
 will (hopefully) point out flaws in the research early on.  Sometimes 
though, it is hard to find colleagues that are motivated and versed 
enough in the subject matter. 
</p><p>
Recognizing that early reviews of research is good, I'm going to try an 
experiment.  I'm going to try to blog my research on  a particular topic
 with the hope that  researchers that are interested in the same topic 
will be able to offer continuous feedback or even contribute directly to
 the research.  My blog will become my research notebook for this topic.
   I've always had great feedback/comments for my research oriented blog
 posts - so I'm hopeful that I'll get a continuous review that will keep
 the research on the proper track.  If a paper results from this line of
 research, constructive critics will be acknowledged, and significant 
contributors to the line of research will be considered to be 
co-authors.
</p><p>
To avoid an entanglements about intellectual property and ownership, 
I'll stick to an area of research that Sun is probably not going to want
 to patent. Obviously, you shouldn't contribute any ideas that you or 
your organization may want to protect.
</p><p>
In the next post, I'll outline the goal for the research project.
</p><p>
Inspiration for the research experiment comes from <a href="https://mir-research.blogspot.com/2007/07/future-of-paper-industry.html">Elias Pampalk</a>, <a href="http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/index.php?s=peer+review">Daniel Lemire</a> and conversations with <a href="http://research.sun.com/people/mybio.php?c=478">Steve Heller</a>.

				Here's a business model:

<ul>
<li>Web mine all of the data you can from <a href="https://last.fm/">Last.fm</a></li> 
<li>Serve their content on your web page surrounded by Google ads</li>
<li>Profit</li>
</ul>
<p>
That's what <a href="http://musicsrc.com/">MusicSRC</a> is doing. 
They've wrapped a subset of Last.fm's functionality and data with some 
Google ads, but they've done nothing new or interesting with the data.  
Not only are they leeching off of Last.fm's tag data, they are also 
leeching Last.fm's bandwidth. The hundred or so images that are 
displayed on every MusicSRC artist page are pulled directly from 
Last.fm's servers.  MusicSRC doesn't even bother acknowledging Last.fm.
</p><p> Maybe MusicSRC has an arrangement with Last.fm that lets them ignore the Last.fm <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/">terms of service</a>,
 but if that's the case they should be doing something a little bit more
 compelling with the data than just wrapping it in Google ads.  Last.fm 
has always been extremely generous with their data, and there's a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=ismir+proceedings+last.fm&amp;btnG=Search">large research community</a> that is depending upon this data. It would be a sad day if Last.fm decided to shut down its web services because of leeches.

</a><a href="http://www.borders.com/online/store/Home">Borders</a> has 
opened their own online bookstore.  Previously, they had relied on 
Amazon to serve as their online presence.  Borders apparently decided 
that letting another bookstore act as their storefront was not in their 
best interest.  One thing that Borders didn't take with them when they 
left Amazon was all of their user data - at least it doesn't look like 
they did.  They have no collaborative filtering recommendations at they 
site at all.
<p>
The only recommendations they offer, as far as I can tell, are 
recommendations for books that have similar metadata.  Instead of the 
Amazonian 'people who bought X also bought Y' Borders offers a "you may 
also like" recommendations that consist of books that have the same 
author or of the same genre/category.  So if you like Harry Potter, 
Borders suggests five other Harry Potter books. If you like the Da Vinci
 Code, Borders suggests 5 other books by DVC author Dan Brown. For a 
book like <a href="http://www.borders.com/online/store/TitleDetail?sku=0393325423">Six Degrees: The science of a connected age</a> by Duncan Watts, Borders offers no recommendations whatsoever.  Malcolm Gladwell's <a href="http://www.borders.com/online/store/TitleDetail?sku=0316010669">Blink</a> is classified as a 'self improvement' book - Borders freakomends <a href="http://www.borders.com/online/store/TitleDetail?sku=0452289963">A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose</a>. (It is a bit telling how sparse the Borders user data is when Borders tells me that I can be the first to rate  'Blink').
</p><p>
In the Borders music store, things seem to be a little better. They are 
showing relevant similar artists. It may be that they are getting this 
data from All Music since they are already using AMG for artist bios.
</p><p>  I find the lack of relevant, novel recommendations at the 
Borders bookstore to be quite puzzling.  In its brick and mortar stores,
 Borders has, no doubt, collected terabytes of data about who likes what
 books.  And yet, Borders doesn't seem to be using any of this data in 
its online store to help connect people with books.  Amazon has reported
 that 35% of its sales are a direct result of their recommendations - so
 it seems crazy that Borders is not taking advantage of their data to 
recommend relevant books.  With a good recommender, Borders could be 
selling a whole lot more books.

				Here's a rather unusual recommendation.  If you are interested <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Six-Steps-Spiritual-Revival-LifeChange/dp/1590520556/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211503568&amp;sr=8-1">in this book</a> by Pat Roberston, the TV Evangelist  and notorious <a href="http://www.hatecrime.org/subpages/hatespeech/robertson.html">homophobe</a> you may be interested in this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Guide-Anal-Sex-Men/dp/157344121X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211503682&amp;sr=1-2">gay sex manual</a>.  This recommendation is not only unusual but it created a bit of a stir in the press and was an <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-976435.html">embarrassment for Amazon</a><p>
  This freakomendation is a result of a small group of folks purposely 
manipulating the Amazon recommender.  These folks merely had to visit 
Pat Robertson's book and then visit another book.  By coordinating their
 actions and visiting the same book (the gay sex manual), they were able
 to manipulate Amazon into making the recommendation that would make Pat
 Roberston blush.

				Well, tonight is the season finale of American Idol, where we get to
 find out which of the two remaining Davids is our American Idol.   It 
will take Fox two hours to reveal that single bit of information.  That 
is a pretty low data transmission rate -  0.5 bits per hour.  If we 
downloaded an MP3 of a 3 minute song at the rate of  0.5 bits per hour 
we'd be waiting  about 800 years for the download to finish.

 Guiness book of world records lists this organ as "largest pipe organ",
 "largest musical instrument ever constructed", and "loudest musical 
instrument ever constructed". The organ has &gt; 32,000  pipes,  
&gt;1,200 stop, 7 manuals (2 with 7 octaves). The low C pipe stands 
64′9″  tall, and weighs 3,350 pounds. It  produces a frequency of 8 Hz 
(the sound of the vibrating pallet is described as "a helicopter 
hovering over the building"). <p>
The pictures are fascinating. <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/rossmcneillie/sets/72157602455998626/">Check out the whole set.</a>

				I'm continuously amazed at the level of detail that <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">findbugs</a> will go to weed a codebase of bugs.  Here's one that I came across today in our codebase:
<p>
</p><pre>        
     String[] segments = path.split(file.separator);
</pre>

<cite>File.separator used for regular expression
The code here uses File.separator where a regular expression is 
required. This will fail on Windows platforms, where the File.separator 
is a backslash, which is interpreted in a regular expression as an 
escape character.</cite>
<p>
I don't live in the Windows world, so it would have been months or years
 before I would have encountered this problem in the wild. Thanks 
FindBugs team!

				I've had my iPhone for about 5 months now. I really like having the 
web in my pocket all of the time.  But when I take my nightly walk, I 
often leave my iPhone behind and bring along my dusty old 3rd generation
 iPod.  My iPhone, with its smaller memory, never seems to have the 
right songs on it.  I've tried to make smart playlists that freshen the 
iPhone with new tracks while keeping many of the old favorites - but it 
always seems that when I'm a couple of miles from home I get a hankering
 for a song that just isn't on my iPhone.  And so I bring along the big 
old iPod. With its 9,000 tracks, it almost always has what I'm looking 
for.  
<p>
I make my living thinking about how to use technology for organizing and
 discovering music. If I can't keep my iPhone fresh with the music that I
 want to listen to, then it is probably hard for most other people too. 
  It is just too hard to manage a device that can't hold all my music.  
So I'm hoping that the next generation iPhone will have much more 
memory.  I'd really like to see the iPod classic combined with the 
iPhone - 160gb of music would be iPhone heaven.
