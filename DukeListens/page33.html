				<p>At JavaOne this year I went to a lot of talks, at least 30 of 
them.&nbsp; After a few of them I started to notice some very bad 
patterns, antipatterns if you will, in many of the talks.&nbsp; These 
are things one should never hear or see in a talk. JavaOne was filled 
with them, even from some very high profile speakers, from some very 
visible companies (and yes, many of them were from Sun).&nbsp; If you 
are going to give a talk at JavaOne, please don't adopt these practices:</p><ul><li>Give
 the same talk as last year.&nbsp; Yep, I saw two very well attended 
talks (1,000+) attendees, where the subject matter (and even the slides)
 of the talk was the same as last year's talk.</li><li>Tell us about 
your broken demo - if you are not showing&nbsp; a demo because it is 
broken, don't even bother telling us about it.&nbsp; One talk had 4 
demos in the slides, but 3 of them were missing, broken, or never 
written.</li><li>Tell us your demo is cool.&nbsp; I'll be the judge of 
what I think is&nbsp; cool.&nbsp; One talk started with the speaker 
telling us he was going to 'knock our socks off', yawn.<br></li><li>Tell
 us you are skipping content because you ran out of time - If you are 
running out of time, adapt, but don't narrate the process.</li><li>Forget what was in your talk.&nbsp; During one very high profile talk, the speaker got to a slide that said <b>Demo</b>.
 The speaker said ... hmmm I wrote these slides two months ago,&nbsp; 
I'm not sure what I was thinking about when I wrote this slide. My 
advice - practice your talk, if you find a&nbsp; slide for a demo that 
you can't remember, delete the slide (they let you delete slides right 
up until your talk).</li></ul><br>

				<p>Tom Conrad of Pandora<a href="http://tomconrad.net/2007/05/13/a-fresh-start/"> posted</a> this on his blog yesterday: </p><blockquote><p><i>On the night of May 22nd, Pandora will be making a series of
announcements that are kind of game changers for us. At the very least
it signals a new chapter in our story.</i></p></blockquote><p>Well, I'm certainly curious. What would be a game changer for Pandora?&nbsp; Some guesses:</p><ol><li> <b>PandoraPod</b>
 - Pandora figures out how you can take your favorite Pandora streams on
 the road - imagine a 4 hour long MP3 of your favorite Pandora Radio 
stations.&nbsp; <br></li><li><b>Pandorapedia-</b> The Social Music 
Genome - Pandora opens up their music analysis to all - letting anyone 
contribute to the music analysis.&nbsp; Think Pandora + Wikipedia&nbsp; 
==&nbsp; Pandorapedia</li><li><b>Classic Pandora</b>&nbsp; - Pandora adds classical music to its catalog <br></li><li><b>iLikePandora</b>
 - Pandora adds all of the social features found in the current crop of 
social music sites (friends, messaging, myspace plugins, tagging, 
youtube videos)&nbsp; <i>No! Please no!</i><br></li><li><b>IndiependiePandora</b> - Pandora becomes a label/venue/storefront for unsigned musicians (think <a href="http://amiestreet.com/welcome">Amie St</a>.)</li><li><b>Pandroid - </b>Pandora replaces its musician analysists with computers trained to listen to music.<br></li><li><b>PandoraPlatform - </b>Pandora sets up shop in <a href="http://www.havenco.com/">Sealand</a> to avoid the compulsory licensing fees</li><li><b>Radio Pandoradise - </b>Pandora replaces their playlisting algorithm with Bill G of <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/index.php">Radio Paradise</a>.<br></li></ol><p>&nbsp;Well, I know lots of people who think about music discovery read this blog ... what do <b>you</b> think is this soon to be announced <i>game changer?</i><br></p>

				<p>During the intense week of JavaOne, I've built up a list of 
technologies that I want to explore after learning about them in 
Moscone.&nbsp; Here are some of the things that are on my post-JavaOne 
To Do list:</p><ul><li>Play with <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/www.jfugue.org">JFugue</a> - its a simple api to use to create music.&nbsp; Lots of fun. <br></li><li>Play with <a href="https://openjfx.dev.java.net/">JavaFX Script </a>- looks like lots of fun - but not fully baked yet.</li><li>Start using <a href="https://netbeans.org/community/releases/60/">Netbeans 6.0 </a>- there are lot's of really powerful features in NB 6 - including a whole bunch of new editing features.</li><li>Learn more about the Java Persistence API and <a href="http://developers.sun.com/javadb/">JavaDB</a></li><li>Learn more about the <a href="https://appframework.dev.java.net/">Swing Application Framework</a>&nbsp; <br></li><li>Play with<a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/"> Sun Spots</a> (I have a couple on my desk as I type this).</li><li>Work with enthusiastic interns that do <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/2007/articles/sonia.jsp">amazing things</a>.</li><li>Think about ways to use <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/mc/mpk20.html">MPk20/Project Wonderland/Darkstar </a>for building a shared music space</li><li>Internalize the best practices for wildcards, bounded types and bounded wildcards as put <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/developers.sun.com/learning/javaoneonline/2006/coreplatform/TS-1512.pdf">forward</a> by Josh Bloch</li><li>Explore using the<a href="http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/"> JMonkey Engine</a> for the next generation of 3D visualizations.<br></li></ul>Add
 this to the tasks that I delayed during the run-up to JavaOne, plus the
 inbox with 2,000 emails in it ... and it looks like it will be a while 
before I get caught up.&nbsp; But it is all fun.<br>

 can create a Rails application using JRuby and Netbeans.&nbsp; In his

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I was really looking forward to the GWT talk at JavaOne (and 
apparently so were many others, there seemed to be a thousand in the 
room during the talk).&nbsp; The talk was presented by two of the core 
GWT team members.&nbsp; They did a super job giving the talk - they were
 relaxed, were polished in their presentation, used humor, didn't get 
fazed by AV glitches.&nbsp; They talked a bit about the philosophy 
behind GWT. They put some stakes in the ground - 'static typing&nbsp; is
 good, dynamic typing is not so good', lots of sexy widgets not so 
important as user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to bring software 
engineering to web development.&nbsp; They claim (and I agree) that it 
is hard to engineer a pile of steaming javascript.&nbsp; Java is much 
better for all its 'abilities' - maintability, adaptability, etc.&nbsp; </p><p>They
 had some good metrics about how users react to load time.&nbsp; If your
 app takes too long, your users will leave.&nbsp; They have a 300ms goal
 for a load time of a rich GWT application - and they are working hard 
always to reduce load time.&nbsp; They do this in a number of ways - 
they use the browser cache to help of course, they make the code they 
ship over the wire be very compressible, and they reduce the overall 
number of http requests (compare that to what is typically done with a 
traditional ajax app, where there may be many trips to the server just 
to get all of the javascript).&nbsp; GWT build separage JS bundles for 
the different browsers, so if you are running in firefox, you don't have
 any IE specific JS.&nbsp; One really neat optimization they are doing 
is called 'image bundles'.&nbsp; Apps that have lots of static images 
can take a long time to load since each image is a separate HTTP 
request.&nbsp; GWT can bundle all of these images into a single image. 
So your app only has to do a single HTTP request to get the images. They
 can then use windowing within this larger image to display the various 
images.&nbsp; A very clever technique.&nbsp; GWT also includes a timing 
framework so you can easily instrument your app so you can see how long 
it takes the app to load.</p><p>They showed some demos ... I was a bit 
disappointed here since they just showed the demos that are available on
 the GWT site. I was also disappointed that they didn't talk much about 
where they were going, what new features were on the roadmap.</p><p>During
 the Q/A one audience member asked about how to write a GWT app that 
could be crawled by search engines like google.&nbsp; The GWT guys knew 
about this problem and they are indeed working hard on making GWT sites 
crawlable.</p><p>&nbsp;All in all, a good session.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>

JavaOne is just so much fun.&nbsp; The days are filled to the brim with 
fun stuff. It's a programmers paradise.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most 
amazing sites ever is walking into the general session and seeing it 
filled wall-to-wall with Java Programmers.&nbsp; 10s of thousands of 
them - it really is quite incredible.&nbsp; I can't imagine how John 
Gage can appear so relaxed and at ease in front of so many people. I had
 the pleasure of sitting down and chatting with John for a few hours a 
couple of weeks ago - he seemed no different when on stage than he did 
sitting in a small room.&nbsp;  </p><p>One of the hardest things about 
JavaOne is that there are just too many different things going on.&nbsp;
 It is hard to decide where to go.&nbsp; I do server programming, web 
programming and desktop programming - I'm interested in tools, I'm 
interested in new language features, I'm interested in scripting 
languages.&nbsp; There's just too much to chose from.&nbsp; I had a chat
 brief chat with the woman who organizes all of the technical sessions. I
 suggested that they release the audio for all of the talks as a series 
of podcasts.&nbsp; She thought that was a good idea.&nbsp; That would 
keep me busy for a year, listening to all of the various talks.&nbsp; I 
hope they do that.<br> </p><p>&nbsp;Some of the highlights for the day:&nbsp; the afternoon tech session with demos of <a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/">World Wind </a>and
 IRIS.&nbsp; The JavaPosse BOF and Neal Gafter's BOF on Closures. Neal 
did a good job convincing me that closures would be a good and 
simplifying addition to the language. I haven't heard any counter 
arguments yet.</p><p>&nbsp;There's a whole lot of buzz around the JavaFX
 stuff.&nbsp; I must admit I am a bit skeptical - perhaps the marketing 
folks have gotten ahead of themselves a bit.&nbsp; F3 is totally cool 
and worthy of a second look, but I'm not sure if it is ready to be 
positioned next to Flash/Apollo and Silverlight as the next generation 
tool for developing hyper-rich web apps.<br></p><p>In the late 
afternoon, I gave my Search Inside the Music talk.&nbsp; It was well 
attended, and was great fun to give.&nbsp; The audience was totally 
engaged - they chuckled at the right spots, participated in the music 
similarity poll stayed awake even while I explained what a Mel Frequency
 Cepstral Coefficient was. They even interrupted the SITM demo several 
times with applause - that's never happened before.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;At the end of the day we had an unofficial Java Music BOF - a bunch of us who do music and Java went out to dinner.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.davekoelle.com/">David Kolle</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/www.jfugue.org/">(JFugue)</a> and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/">Geertjann</a>
 (I really did try to learn how to pronounce his name, but it is just 
not possible for my New England tongue to do so), Matt Warman (he makes a
 guitar tab program that uses JFugue),&nbsp; and Michael Good <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/www.recordare.com/xml.html">(MusicXML)</a> had some spicy Chinese food and good conversations about music and Java. </p><p>It
 is 8AM on Wednesday, time to head over for day 2 - lots of good 
sessions today too - Project Caroline, Effective Java Reloaded,&nbsp; a 
GWT talk,&nbsp; extreme gui makeover,&nbsp; F3, darkstar, wonderland, 
java se media, take 2.&nbsp; It will be a full day. Plus I really want 
to spend some time in the pavillion - I've only had a few moments to 
walk through - my biggest surprise there was seeing the Microsoft booth.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>I arrived in SFO at around 1PM (after sitting 100 yards from the 
gate for a frustrating hour waiting for another plane to leave the 
gate). I checked into the hotel (the venerable Sir Francis Drake), and 
walked down to Moscone for the early registration and to see if anything
 was going on.  There were lots of folks there ready to help.  It took 
all of 2 minutes to register.  I got my speaker badge, my nice J1 
backpack (only a few goodies inside), and my lunch tickets.  I was also 
able to register for CommunityOne - the combined NetBeans and Glassfish 
event.

Today is the third anniversary of 'Duke Listens!'.&nbsp; On May 3, 2004, I posted my <a href="welcome_all.html">first blog entry</a>.&nbsp;
 At the time, I was still working on speech engines, and the blog name 
was "Duke Speaks!".&nbsp; My first post that hinted about my interest in
 music information retrieval occurred a month later with this <a href="patent_idea_1.html">windshield wiper entry.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Over
 the last 3 years, I've really benefited from this blog. First, by 
writing about this field, I actually remember things a whole lot better 
than I would otherwise.&nbsp; The blog serves as my secondary storage, I
 may not remember all of the details about a subject or a company, but I
 may remember that I spent an hour writing about it, so I can look it up
 in the blog.&nbsp; Second, the blog has opened many doors.&nbsp; Many 
times I have blogged about a new music recommender startup only to 
receive an email from the CEO a day later.&nbsp; I now have a virtual 
Rolodex filled with all of the movers and shakers in the digital music 
world (with one significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">exception</a>).</p><p>Three
 years and 576 posts later, I'd like to thank all of my reader for 
sending me emails, leaving comments and keeping things interesting here.
 I'd especially like to thank Sun Management for making this soapbox 
available without worrying that I'm going to say something stupid.<br></p>

Westergren, CEO of Pandora writes:</p><blockquote><p style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold;"><b><i><span style="font-size: 85%;">
Today we have some extremely disappointing news to share with you. Due
to international licensing constraints, we are deeply, deeply sorry to
say that we must begin proactively preventing access to Pandora's
streaming service for most countries outside of the U.S. </span></i></b></p>       <p style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 85%;"><b><i>
It is difficult to convey just how disappointing this is for us. Our
vision remains to eventually make Pandora a truly global service, but
for the time being, we can no longer continue as we have been. As a
small company, the best chance we have of realizing our dream of
Pandora all around the world is to grow as the licensing landscape
allows</i></b>. </span></p></blockquote><p>It is especially tough 
sledding lately for Pandora and other Internet Radio Stations as they 
struggle to survive in a world filled with copyright owners trying to 
extract every possible penny from every song play.<br></p>

				<p>&nbsp;I've been busy preparing for my <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/sf/">JavaOne</a>
 talk.&nbsp; I'll be talking about music recommendation, and 
content-based music recommendation in particular, as well as showing off
 the SITM demo.&nbsp; I've added a few visualizations to the demo to 
spiff it up. &nbsp; My boss calls the visualizations "gratuitous 
eye-candy" - which I translate to mean that he thinks that they are 
really cool.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was particularly inspired by the latest <a href="https://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> graphic to add some more interesting ways of grouping album art.&nbsp; Here's the Apple TV image:</p><p align="center"><img src="support_files/appletv.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="400">&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a screen shot of SITM:</p><p align="center"><a href="http://support_files/sitm4_crop.gif"><img src="./page33_files/sitm4_crop_small.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><i>(Album artwork used courtesy of <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune.com)</a>&nbsp;</i></p><p>The SITM talk at JavaOne is on Tuesday May 8th at 4:40 PM - 5:40 PM.&nbsp; I hope to see you there. <br></p>

Artist name matching can be a real pain in the neck.&nbsp; First, there 
are all of those international spellings and affectations like <font size="-1"><span class="a">KoЯn,&nbsp;</span></font> 
				 
			Die Ärzte,&nbsp; 
				 
			宇多田ヒカ, and Sp<span class="Unicode"><a title="Dotless i" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotless_i">ı</a><a title="Heavy metal umlaut" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_umlaut">n̈</a></span>al
 Tap. In addition, there are variations: "Emerson, Lake and Palmer" vs. 
"Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer", or "The Beatles" vs. "Beatles, The".&nbsp;
 And finally, there are the many misspellings (<a href="http://labs.google.com/britney.html">500+ ways to spell Britney Spears</a>).&nbsp;
 A typical collection of MP3s has many such matching challenges 
infecting the artist, album and track names.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what to 
do?&nbsp; You can use DAn Ellis's method for <a href="http://blush.ee.columbia.edu/projects/musicsim/normalization.html">artist name normalization</a>,
 but this doesn't work too well for international names, nor does it 
handle misspellings.&nbsp; You could use an audio fingerprinter like <a href="http://musicip.com/dns/index.jsp">MusicDNS,</a>
 that will extract an encoding-insensitive hash for an audio file that 
can be turned into a song ID, but if you have a million songs to process
 this can take quite a while. </p><p>An alternative is to use some of 
the algorithms specifically designed for name matching.&nbsp; These 
algorithms can deal well with the typical errors found in names.&nbsp; 
One matching algorithm, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro-Winkler">Jaro-Winkler </a>metric was designed by a couple of statisticians at the U.S. Census Bureau to explicitly deal with name matching.&nbsp; </p><p>There's a good overview of the various name-matching algorithms in this <a href="http://secondstring.sourceforge.net/doc/iiweb03.pdf">paper,</a> and there's a neat open source Java package that implements many of these algorithms called <a href="http://secondstring.sourceforge.net/">SecondString.</a>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>

				<p>Keeping with the <a href="building_a_better_recommender_not.html">tastemaker</a> theme for the day, be sure to read Steve Krause's post: <a href="http://www.stevekrause.org/steve_krause_blog/2007/04/watts_2.html">Is Predicting Hit Songs Futile?</a><br>Steve
 has been looking at the recent Duncan Watt's study on how social memes 
such as 'hits' spread through social networks.&nbsp; Watts says that it 
is not tastemakers that influence how fast a new song spreads, it is how
 susceptible the audience is to a new idea.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><i>The principal requirement for what we call "global cascades"—the
widespread propagation of influence through networks—is the presence
not of a few influentials but, rather, of a critical mass of easily
influenced people, each of whom adopts, say, a look or a brand after
being exposed to a single adopting neighbor.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br></p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Most music recommendations are based on collaborative filtering 
algorithms.&nbsp; Sites like last.fm, goombah, qloud and iLike use the 
'wisdom of the crowds' to find related artists or songs. &nbsp; Using 
these techniques yield pretty good recommendations, but they could be 
better.&nbsp; For instance, in a collaborative filtering system, the 
opinion of a highly-engaged music listener, the 'super-fan' if you will,
 counts the same as the casual or indifferent listener.&nbsp; A CF 
system can't tell the difference between a Pitchfork music critic, 
listening to the latest Deerhoof album over and over so they can write 
the review, and a jogger that listens to the latest Deerhoof album over 
and over because it is good music for running.&nbsp; A music recommender
 should recognize that not all opinions are created equal, that some 
people really do know better than others. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>One attempt at focusing on taste makers is the site <a href="http://www.whenkilledlikeroosters.com/">When Killed Like Roosters</a>.&nbsp;
 WKLR is a music recommendation site that, unlike a traditional social 
recommender, will give extra weight to the opinions of the 
highly-engaged music listener.&nbsp; WKLR mines the taste data of music 
bloggers, those that care enough about music to write about it - and 
provides <a href="http://www.whenkilledlikeroosters.com/albums/">charts</a>
 of the most highly rated music based upon these tastemaker 
ratings.&nbsp;&nbsp; WKLR seems to have gone quiet over the last few 
months - so this is not an idea that is taking over the world by storm. 
Still, I think we will be seeing more CF systems that try to find the 
taste makers and the trend setters and give the opinions of these 
individuals more weight.<br></p>

				<p>There are lots of news stories about our favorite social music recommender last.fm.&nbsp; First, they acquired rights to <a href="http://www.digitalmediaasia.com/default.asp?ArticleID=23724">stream all 800,000 tracks from the IODA </a>catalog.
 &nbsp; Second - the rumor mill is churning about Viacom trying to 
purchase last.fm with a target purchase price of $450 million.&nbsp; But
 for the really big news, one has to read between the lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a regular reader of the <a href="https://mir-research.blogspot.com/">MIR Research blog</a>, you'll notice that Elias Pampalk has been<a href="https://mir-research.blogspot.com/2007/03/is-industry-outrunning-mir-research.html"> talking about social tagging</a> and the wisdom of the crowds vs. the algorithmic approaches used in academic research.&nbsp; It seems that Elias has got the <i>tag religion</i>. &nbsp; Combine that with <a href="https://elias-in-tsukuba.blogspot.com/2007/04/24-hours.html">this post </a>Elias makes in his personal blog about his unnamed <i>new job in London</i>
 - and it is not hard to guess that Last.fm may be adding another 
top-notch MIR researcher to their staff.&nbsp; That's great news for 
Last.fm - Elias is smart, very passionate about music and music 
discovery, and shares my love for interesting and engaging interfaces to
 music.&nbsp; Last.fm would do well, to add Elias to the 
team.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, this is just a rumor ... waiting for Elias to 
confirm or deny. </p><p><i>Update:&nbsp; Elias <a href="https://mir-research.blogspot.com/2007/05/recent-events.html">confirms.</a></i><br></p>
