				There's an interesting article in MIT Tech Review: <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?ch=infotech&amp;sc=&amp;id=17183&amp;pg=1" target="_self">Audio Software for the Moody Listener</a>
 about a batch of research systems that allow content-based exploration

 as a primary factor for these systems, when in fact most of them seem 
to not use mood at all.&nbsp; The article highlights a few systems

My question is why would they want to? What would that achieve for the user? Is there a major need to identify covers? 
<br><br>
A banjo version of Stairway to Heaven is almost entirely unrelated musically to Led Zeppelin.

                Ian: If you can get good at identifying literal covers 
(Stairway to Heaven on a banjo), then you will also get good at 
identifying interpretive covers.  These are songs that are not 
necessarily "perfect" translations, but songs that are influenced or 
otherwise harmonically or melodically similar or related.  

For example, there was a lawsuit a decade ago over whether Andrew Lloyd 
Weber had stolen the tune of a Baltimore songwriter named Ray Repp.  
Whether or not this is true, it would be very interesting for me to be 
able to pick one song as my query, and then get a similarity-based 
ranked list of all other songs that _could_ be covers of my query.

You could use this cover-finder for plagiarism detection, but IMO that 
is a bit boring.  More interesting would be to find hints of historial 
influence.  It is very common in music to "creatively quote" other 
musicians.. especially ones that you like.  In this manner, you can 
actually build up a bit of inferential logic about who was listening to 
whom, historically.  

And I'm not alone in thinking this is interesting.  There are actually a
 good number of bands recently that have started to put out "under the 
influence of" compilations.. where it is basically a CD filled with 
songs that influence their own music.  

Suppose now that you can identify songs that are likely "influences" 
(covers) of each other, and then use that to infer who was listening to 
what.  That could be an extremely interesting method for discovering new
 music.

                hey,

is the there any reseach sun research project related with music 
similarity recognition? I ve done some basic work myself based on 
synthetized human sound comparision against melodic countour that may 
potentially be indexed and stored as metatadata for realtime searchs for
 "song recognition" based on human synthetized melodic countour and 
rythm.

Unfortunately, im not really aware of the different research initiatives
 related with music similarity, so i was wondering if you can guide me a
 little bit.
