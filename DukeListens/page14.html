				Here's an unusual recommendation from <a href="http://www.mystrands.com/artist/3172/recommendations">MyStrands</a>,
 but in a good way, not a bad way.  While I was listening to some Aphex 
Twin I checked the MyStrands application to see what they recommended.  
MyStrands evidently didn't have enough data to give a good 
recommendation, and so they told me that - they didn't blindly give me a
 bad recommendation, they recommended something popular, but they also 
told me that they were punting on a specific recommendation.

	<div class="entry-content">
				<a href="http://onellama.com/PlaylistMaker/index.jsp"><img style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="support_files/logo.png"></a>One
 Llama is a music recommender that uses "acoustic analysis, cultural 
analysis and collaborative filtering tools for music navigation, 
discovery and search. On their website they say <em>One Llama uses a 
combination of Collaborative Filtering and Audio Similarity modeling to 
generate recommendations. Our model harvests cultural references and 
social networking data about each track, and listens to the audio using 
an advanced "virtual ear." The result is a stronger combined logic for 
all our recommendations. The One Llama method has the advantage of being
 able to give intelligent recommendations for new audio tracks 
immediately while becoming increasingly smarter as additional 
information is collected about the tracks from playlists, downloads, 
user feedback, etc.</em>
<p>
So with all that advanced mojo, one would expect some pretty good 
recommendations.  Here's a recommendation based on the seed song 'Hey 
Jude' (I chose the Elvis version because they didn't seem to have the 
Beatles version in their catalog).
</p><p>
<a href="http://onellama.com/PlaylistMaker/GetPlaylist?artist=3&amp;numSongs=10&amp;keyword=ELVIS+PRESLEY+-+Hey+Jude&amp;x=14&amp;y=11"><img src="support_files/_onellama-heyjude.png" alt="onellama-heyjude.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
There's no doubt that these songs are "like 'Hey Jude'", but somehow the
 recommendation lacks subtlety and novelty of a real recommendation.  
Clearly the songs are not acoustically similar (Arthur Fielder vs. Tiny 
Tim?), and I can't imagine any set of users that would be listening to 
this set of song, so this is not being driven by a collaborative 
filtering algorithm.  It seems that, at least for this recommendation, 
the primary driving force is metadata similarity. It is almost as if 
they just grabbed the Musicbrainz track data, tossed it all into a text 
similarity engine and turned the crank to get these similarities.
</p><p>
Zac points out another case where One Llama seems to be relying mostly 
on metadata.  Here's a playlist that One LLama generates for songs 
similar to  "Let Go" by Frou Frou.  The set seems mostly reasonable from
 an acoustic point of view - the playlist could have been constructed by
 an expert - and in fact it was.  The songs (with one exception) can all
 be found on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garden-State-Various-Artists/dp/B0002J58LK">Garden State soundtrack</a>.
<a href="http://onellama.com/PlaylistMaker/GetPlaylist?artist=3&amp;numSongs=10&amp;keyword=FROU+FROU+-+Let+Go&amp;x=19&amp;y=12"><img src="support_files/_shins-one-llama.png" alt="shins-one-llama.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
This is probably what one could expect from a collaborative filtering 
system. Lots of music listeners have bought the soundtrack. Any good CF 
algorithm will notice this and tie the items together. However, I don't 
think that is what is going on here.  Looking at the One LLama playlist,
 there is one song that is not on the Garden State album.  One Llama has
 added The Postal Service's 'Such Great Heights' to the playlist, while 
the Garden State has the cover of 'Such Great Heights' by Iron &amp; 
Wine - although this is a cover, they sound very different; one is 
electronic-noise-pop, while the other is strictly acoustic.  I suspect 
that, as with the Hey Jude example, One Llama is relying mostly on 
metadata similarity to determine similarity

</p><p>
Here's the track list for the Garden State:
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Garden-State-Various-Artists/dp/B0002J58LK"><img src="support_files/_amazon-garden-state.png" alt="amazon-garden-state.png" border="0"> </a>
</p><p>
Using metadata to generate track similarity is not inherently bad. It 
makes sense to use what works best.  A young recommender company like 
One Llama doesn't have the deep user data necessary to generate good CF 
recommendations.  Creating recommendations based on automatic acoustic 
analysis is really hard, acoustic-based recommendations are frequently 
prone to making mistakes that no human would make. I suspect that One 
Llama has adjusted the dials on their recommender to give more weight to
 the metadata until they get more user data and their automated analysis
 is up to par.

<img style="float: right; margin: 10px;" src="support_files/_stalin&#32;similar&#32;artists.png" alt="stalin similar artists.png" border="0">
<p>Last.fm has a similar artist feature. When you are looking at the 
page for an artist they will show you artists that are similar based 
upon the wisdom of the crowds.  Last.fm can tell you for instance, that 
people who listen to Emerson, Lake and Palmer also listen to Yes.  
</p><p>
If you go the <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hillary+Rodham+Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> page at Last.fm and take a look at her 'similar artists' you'll find a motley crew that includes <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joseph+Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> and <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Adolf+Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.  Perhaps not the types of world leaders that Hillary would want to be associated with.
</p><p>
It is even worse if you go to <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Joseph+Stalin">Joseph Stalin's</a>
 page, where you'll find similar artists such as Michael Savage, Ann 
Coulter and Rush Limbaugh.

Now this was clearly engineered as a prank. Someone (or a group of 
someones), must have created a playlist  with Hillary, Adolf, Coulter, 
Limbaugh and Stalin and just played them over and  over again, feeding 
their play data into the Last.fm <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/">audioscrobbler</a>
 until Last.fm noticed the correlation and declared that they were 
similar artists.  This is one of the first instances of I've seen where a
 music recommender has been noticeably manipulated to produce a 
dishonest recommendation. It certainly demonstrates how these types of 
systems can be vulnerable to attack.
</p><p>
Luckily, there are some smart people working to protect us from this hacking.  <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/">Bamshad Mobasher </a>has some <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/mbbw-acmtoit-07.pdf">good</a> <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/wmb-soca07.pdf">papers</a> on the <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/bbm-itwp07.pdf">topic</a> that are <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/mbbs-ieee-intsys-07.pdf">worth</a> <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/papers/bbm-dmin07.pdf">reading</a>.
</p><p>
As more people seek out long tail content, recommenders will become 
increasingly important, which means that the folks who are spamming and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_blog">splogging</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">seo</a>-ing, will be trying to hack our recommenders to get their remedies for hair loss treatment at the top of the list. <em>(Thanks Elias)</em>

				I was looking at the <a href="https://www.google.com/musica?aid=8ckX4huwkz&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=music&amp;ct=result">Keith Fullerton Whitman Google Music page</a>
 when I noticed that there was a Google Sponsored Link on the side for 
Pandora.  KFW is not exactly a mainstream artist, so it seemed odd that 
Pandora would be purchasing Sponsored Links for his page. Well, I 
clicked on the link and much to my surprise I was brought to a Pandora 
Radio station for Goldenboy.  Now, lets be clear, there's absolutely no 
similarity between Goldenboy and KFW.  Looking at the google page, I 
can't figure out the reason behind the Pandora ad placement. Something 
went awry somewhere - or perhaps there's some connection between KFW and
 Goldenboy that I don't know about. Perhaps Pandora or the Echonest can 
answer the question.

				I hope people don't think I am picking on Amazon. Amazon clearly has
 one of the best recommenders in the world.  The last time I went to 
Amazon, I intended to buy 1 book,  I ended up with 5 all because of 
their recommender.  99% of the recommendations from the Amazon 
recommender are spot on - but there's a small number of recommendations 
that are surprising, funny or just plain crazy.  Now this doesn't always
 mean that these are bad recommendations.  For example, here's one that 
was sent to me by <a href="http://flyingpudding.com/">Anita Lillie</a>. She says:
<p>
<em>I noticed you are posting freakomendations on your blog, and it 
reminded me of how I was looking for flowers for a mother-in-law-type 
person for Christmas last year, and I got a recommendation for the video
 game Halo.  I went back today to try to find the same recommendation, 
but I couldn't find it.  Instead, I see a "recommendation" ("other 
customers who bought... also bought...") for the movie "Hot Fuzz" fairly
 frequently within the "flowering indoor plants" product category. 
Anyway, it was particularly funny with the Halo, and I'm guessing it's 
all those 20-something guys who go online to order something for their 
moms.</em>
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Windowbox-Potted-Peace-Lily/dp/B0001WYNDM/ref=sr_1_17"><img src="support_files/_Picture&#32;5.png" alt="Picture 5.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
As Anita suggests, the demographic of Amazon flower purchases probably 
skews to 20-somthing guys getting something for their moms, so throwing 
in Halo or Hot Fuzz, may not be a bad way for Amazon to make an extra 
sale or two.

 on John Scalzi's blog: 

"Today Amazon suggested The Last Colony to me for purchase. Yeah, you 
know, I’ve read that. But it’s nice to know Amazon’s algorithm thinks I 
might like my own stuff."

One interesting <a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=677#comment-30663">comment</a>: <em>Amazon’s
 algorithm also has an annoying (well, it was funny the first time, 
since it happened on April 1st. But then it kept on happening, and I 
realized they were serious) habit of treating writer’s names, without 
bothering to check if it’s the same writer or not. I bought a few of 
Sharon Lee’s and Steve Miller’s Liaden Universe books through Amazon. So
 they started to give me recommendation for other books by Steve Miller.
 Which would have been fine, except this new Steve Miller is a 
completely different Steve Miller and Amazon apparently thinks I would 
really like illustration advice books.</em>
</p><p>
This is what happened with<a href="freakomendations.html"> yesterday's Steve Martin freakomendation</a>, where Amazon recommended a book by the wrong Steve Martin. <a href="https://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a>,
 another book recommender, at least understands that there are two Steve
 Martin's that write books, but they still can't tell them apart. At the
 <a href="https://www.librarything.com/author/martinsteve&amp;norefer=1">LibraryThing author page for Steve Martin</a> there is this notice: <em>Steve
 Martin is actually two authors, Steve Martin the comedian and author of
 Cruel Shoes, Kindly Lent By Their Owner: The Private Collection of 
Steve Martin, Shopgirl, Pure Drivel, WASP, The Pleasure of My Company, 
and Born Standing Up; and Steve Martin the author of Britain and the 
Slave Trade. In the future LibraryThing will be able to split authors 
with identical names. At present, it cannot. </em>  
</p><p>
This makes be appreciate <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a> so much more.  MusicBrainz knows all about the various <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/search/textsearch.html?query=oasis&amp;type=artist&amp;limit=&amp;handlearguments=1">ambiguous artist names</a> and can tell them apart.  I guess there's no such thing as BookBrainz yet.

			<h3><a href="content_analysis_and_the_cold.html" title="permalink">Content analysis and the cold-start problem</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				A classic problem in traditional collaborative filtering 
recommendation is the 'cold start' problem.  It is hard to generate 
recommendations for new items because there isn't enough taste data 
about the new items to make reliable correlations with other items.  
That's where content analysis comes in. The cold start problem can be 
alleviated by basing recommendations on similarity of content as well as
 the wisdom of the crowds.  New items can be analyzed and enrolled into a
 recommender, making these items available and recommendable. 
<p>
However, using content-based techniques doesn't guarantee the 
elimination of the cold-start problem.  Pandora, everyone's favorite 
Internet Radio, uses content-analysis to drive their customized radio. 
However, since Pandora performs all of their analysis by hand, there may
 be some lag before your favorite artist makes it into the Pandora 
catalog.
</p><p>
There's another content-based recommender - <a href="http://beta.booklamp.org/">BookLamp.org</a>.  The BookLamp F.A.Q describe BookLamp as a
</p><blockquote>"book recommendation system that uses the full text of a
 book to match it to other books based on scene-by-scene measurements of
 elements such as pacing, density, action, dialog, description, 
perspective, and genre, among others. In other words, BookLamp.org is a 
Pandora.com for books, based on an author's writing style. If you match 
against multiple books, the self-learning system adjusts your formulas 
to make the match specific to your tastes. As the system moves out of 
beta, it will also incorporate human feedback into the recommendation 
systems, blending the strengths of social networks with the strengths of
 computer analysis. Ultimately, we want users to be able to create and 
share their own formulas, creating a community of book lovers that have 
tools to discover and share books in a way never before possible.

Because the system matches books through objective data from the text 
itself instead of relying solely on social networks to generate 
recommendations, the recommendations are impervious to outside 
influences such as advertising or author marketing. It also allows you 
to match to a far greater detail than alternative systems. With 
BookLamp, you can request a book similar to Stephen King's The Stand, 
but half the length, first person, literary mainstream fiction, with 
slightly more dialog, less description, and a rising action level across
 the first 10 scenes. If that's what you're looking for".</blockquote>
<p>
It is a neat idea, and sounds very similar to the types of things we are
 doing with Search Inside the Music and Project Aura.  Using content 
analysis gives you better ways to help people discover new items. 
However, BookLamp has its own cold start problem.  Again, from the 
BookLamp FAQ:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote><strong>Does BookLamp Work? Can I use it right now to find a book to read?
</strong><p>
	The simple answer to this question is that while BookLamp works, it 
doesn't have enough books in the database to work well. While the 
technology behind the system is capable of finding you books to read 
right now, BookLamp will remain a technology demonstration until we have
 a large enough database of books to give the system enough data to make
 realistic recommendations. Without more books, not only will most users
 have a hard time finding a book to match against, but the system will 
have a limited number of books that are capable of being matches. In 
other words, if we don't have a book in the database that matches, we 
won't be able to recommend a book for you. Additionally, with so few 
books in the database, we're not able to match against all the metrics 
that we would like. In order to be the most effective, BookLamp needs to
 match against 7 to 8 metrics; with less than 300 books in the database,
 we're having to make recommendations after matching against only 3 or 4
 metrics. To get any matches at all, we've had to turn down the 
sensitivity of the measures (see the next question) a bit already.We 
estimate that it will take a database of at least 10,000 books to make 
BookLamp a usable system. The more, the better.</p></blockquote>
<p>
So BookLamp has a bit of a problem, with only 300 books in its database,
 it is not going to be the best book recommender.  And unlike music, it 
is not so easy to enroll a new book - scanners and page turners are 
involved.  So BookLamp is trying to figure out its next step. If I were 
them, I'd build a recommender for the  <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">Gutenberg project</a>
 with its over 25,000 titles. Of course there are no NY Times best 
sellers in the bunch, but it would be a great way to fine tune the 
content-analysis while providing a service to a worthy project.

			<h3><a href="using_aardvark.html" title="permalink">Using Aardvark</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				As a way to demonstrate some of the capabilities of Project Aura, 
we've created Aardvark, a blog recommender.  Of course, the world 
probably doesn't need another blog recommender - but by building a blog 
recommender we get some experience dealing with a really large dataset 
that has lots of interesting characteristics.  For one thing, we are 
using content analysis, classification and autotagging to help identify 
relevant content. We use incoming links and attention to determine how 
much authority a particular entry has on a topic. Since we use content 
as well as social data to identify relevant content,  we are less 
susceptible to the cold start problem, and we are able to create 
recommendations based upon topics not just the usual "people who read X 
also read Y".
<p>
We didn't want to build yet another blog reader, everyone already has 
their favorite way to read blogs - and we didn't want to spend a lot of 
time crafting an attractive web interface like the <a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_JQ7fxW3ASg4/R31KHmGgdSI/AAAAAAAACQA/XCO8vTYWviY/s1600-h/Findory+home+page+cropped.jpg">Findory</a>.
 Instead, we wanted to focus primarily on the back-end, on the quality 
of the recommendations. So instead of spending our time writing a fancy 
blog reader that you wouldn't want to use anyway, we just made it work 
with our favorite blog reader: <a href="https://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>.
</p><p>
Here's how it works.  Read your blogs in Google Reader like you always 
do.  When you read an item that is particularly interesting add a star 
(using the Google Reader 'add star' link).  Over time you should build 
up a pretty good collection of items that represents your interest.  For
 Aardvark to generate recommendations for you, we need to learn what 
your preferences are. Luckily, the Google Reader allows you to export 
your starred items as a feed. 
</p><p></p><center> <img src="support_files/_aardvark_starred_items.png" alt="aardvark_starred_items.png" border="0"></center>
<p> In Google Reader, navigate to your settings/tags section, where you 
can 'view public page' for your starred items.   On this page you'll 
find a link to your starred item feed.  Copy that so you can paste it 
into Aardvark. Here are my <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/shared/user/07268145224739680674/state/com.google/starred">starred items</a>.  </p><p>
Now you are ready to get recommendations from Aardvark.  First, login to Aardvark (note that this isn't publicly available yet).
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="support_files/_aardvark_login.png" alt="aardvark_login.png" border="0"></center>
<p>
You can use your OpenID to register.  When you register you paste in the
 URL to your starred item feed. Now Aardvark can notice the items that 
you are starring and generate recommendations for you based upon these 
items.
</p><p>
</p><center><img src="support_files/_aardvark_registration.png" alt="aardvark_registration.png" border="0"></center>

<p>
Once you register, Aardvark will give you a few feeds that you can add 
to Google Reader.  This is where Aardvark will send your 
recommendations:
</p><p></p><center><img src="support_files/_aardvark_main.png" alt="aardvark_main.png" border="0"></center>
<p>
After you add the recommendation feed to Google Reader, Aardvark will 
keep the feed filled with items that you might find interesting:
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_aardvark_googlereader.png" alt="aardvark_googlereader.png" border="0">
</p><p>
Well, there you have it, a quick tour of how you can use Aardvark to get
 blog recommendations.  We aren't quite ready to make it available to 
the general public - but if you think you might be interested, you can 
at least start to star items in Google Reader, so that when we are 
ready, you'll be ready.
</p><p>
BTW, Jeff built the web interface and integrated the OpenId support. The site really looks great.

				I was going to respond to Mark Cohen's post on the<a href="https://ad-supported-music.blogspot.com/2008/04/myth-of-music-discovery.html"> Myth of Music Discovery</a>.
  Based on recent survey data showing  that  the plurality of people 
still discovery new music via radio, Marc concludes that music discovery
 is passive  and that downloaded ad-supported music will be the superior
 vehicle for music discovery. I was going to write about how I thought 
Marc's conclusions were just a lot of bunk. But luckily David Jennings 
(of Net, Blogs and Rock 'n' Roll fame) has written a cogent (and less 
insulting) response.  So, instead of writing a response - I'm going to 
just redirect you to  David's:  <a href="http://www.netblogsrocknroll.com/2008/04/the-myth-scienc.html">The myth, science and craft of music discovery</a>.

<p>
Two weeks from today is the second<a href="http://sanfranmusictech.com/"> SanFran MusicTech Summit</a>.
  The summit is a convergence of musicians, technologists, business and 
legal folk that are in someway connected with the world of music.  The 
event is organized by<a href="http://www.futureofmusic.org/about/members.cfm#bz"> Brian Zisk</a>, one of the founders of the <a href="http://www.futureofmusic.org/">Future of Music</a>
 coalition.  This summit is lining up to be even better than the last.  
Lots of really interesting panelists from companies such as Pandora, 
Apple, CD Baby, YouTube, SeeqPod, iMeem, Google, Rhapsody, Songza, 
Gracenote, and Sony, as well as some A-List bloggers including Mike 
Arringtion (Techcrunch), Pete Crashmore (Mashable), and Om Malick 
(GigaOm). (See the <a href="http://sanfranmusictech.com/speakers.html">full speaker list</a>)
</p><p>
I'm lucky enough to be on the agenda to give a short technology demo of 
Search Inside the Music and Project Aura.  I just can't imagine a 
better-suited audience for this demo - I'm really looking forward to it.
