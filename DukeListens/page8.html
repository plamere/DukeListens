				My notes from the ISMIR 2008 - <a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/keynote">invited speaker talk</a> <b>Abstract</b>: <i>
 In my talk, I will describe five properties that help make music sound 
tonal — or “good,” to most listeners. I will then show that combining 
these properties is mathematically non-trivial, with the consequence 
that space of possible tonal musics is severely constrained.  This leads
 me to construct higher-dimensional geometrical representations of 
musical structure, in which it is clear how the various properties can 
be combined.  Finally, I will show that Western music combines these 
five properties at two different temporal levels: the immediate level of
 the chord, and the long-term level of the scale.  The resulting music 
is hierarchically self-similar, exploiting the same basic procedures on 
two different time scales.  In fact, one and the same twisted cubic 
lattice describes the musical relationships among common chords and 
scales. </i>
<p> In this talk, Dmitri explained his geometrical model of music 
structure.  He uses the model to explain ow harmony and counterpoint. 
The gist of the talk can be found in this Science article: <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/313/5783/72">The Geometry of Musical Chords</a>. A good talk, interesting subject matter (but I must admit I'm skeptical).

on social tags and MIR. The tutorial was well attended - and we had lots
 of good questions at the end of it all.  Much thanks to Elias for being
 such a gracious co-speaker. We had a very tight timetable for the talk -
 and I took longer to present my bits than I was scheduled for - but 
Elias seamlessly shortened his parts to make up for my overages.

				I'm taking notes during ISMIR - since some people may be interested, I'm blog them.
<p>
ISMIR kicks off with a tutorial on the ChucK language, presented by Ge 
Wang (Stanford) and Rebecca Fiebrink (Princeton).  This is a hands on 
tutorial based on the <a href="http://audicle.cs.princeton.edu/mini/mac/">miniAudicle</a>.
</p><p>
Ge
Ge Wang gave an overview of core language features:
</p><ul>
<li> The chuck operator:<br> <img src="support_files/chuck_logo.jpg">
</li><li> Example:

<pre>Impulse i =&gt; dac;

while (true)
{
      1 =&gt; i.next;
      100::ms =&gt; now;
}
</pre>
This program clicks the speaker every 10th second

</li></ul>

<p>

Next Ge Wang explains all about time and concurrency. Ge Wang is coding on the fly in response to a question ... he has no fear.
</p><p>
Next Ge Wang coded up some demos - cool sounds.  Ge Wang demonstrated 
the audicle - which has all sorts of interesting visualizations of the 
active shreds.

</p><p>
It's about time for me to finalize prep for the social tags tutorial - 
so I shall miss the second half on the tutorial.  Too bad, since this 
has been a great intro to ChucK and I'd like to hear more.

<p>
<img src="support_files/_IMG_0566.JPG" alt="IMG_0566.JPG" border="0" width="600">

My first view of the volume, still in bubble wrap.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_IMG_0567.JPG" alt="IMG_0567.JPG" border="0" width="600">
</p><p>
Out of the box, but still wrapped in the protective covering. Never touched my human hands.

<img src="support_files/_IMG_0568.JPG" alt="IMG_0568.JPG" border="0" width="600">

And finally, out of the cover.  It is so very shiny. Shinier than my iPhone.

Here's the back side. It is definitely thicker than my iPod.  Notice the
 crack in the Liberty Bell. Apparently all Version 1 copies of the 
proceedings are exhibiting the same susceptibility to cracking.

And finally a peek inside -- nice to see Sun on the sponsorship page.

The proceedings are just beautiful. The ISMIR  2008 organizers have done
 just an incredible job.  I am glad I decided to get the hard copy.

	<div class="entry-content">
				Elias and I have been working hard to prepare for our tutorial on 
Social Tags and Music Information Retrieval that we are presenting in a 
couple of days at ISMIR.  We are presenting a whole lot of material in 
this three hour tutorial.  Perhaps too much for anyone to be able to 
remember it all. With this in mind we are creating a site called <a href="http://socialmusicresearch.org/">SocialMusicResearch.org</a>
 that will be the clearing house for all of the material that we present
 during the tutorial.  At this site you'll find our slides, links to 
code, links to data, our bibliography and other pointers to interesting 
topics relevant to social tags and music information retrieval.
<p>
<a href="http://support_files/_socialmusicresearch.png"><img src="support_files/_socialmusicresearch.png" alt="socialmusicresearch.png" border="0" width="500"></a>
</p><p>
Instead of just creating a static site, we've set up 
SocialMusicResearch.org as a wiki - so that other researchers that are 
interested in social tags and music can contribute and help make this 
the place to go to learn all about social tags and music information 
retrieval, and social music in general.
</p><p>
We've just started populating the wiki so now's the time to get involved
 if you like being in on the ground.  If you'd like to start 
contributing to the wiki,<a href="https://identity.sun.com/amserver/UI/Login?org=self_registered_users&amp;goto=http%3A%2F%2Fwikis.sun.com%2Fdashboard.action&amp;os_destination=%2Fdashboard.action"> sign up</a> and let me know your user ID (email it to <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6a3a0b1f0644260b070f180f2a191f0444090507">[email&#160;protected]</a>) and I'll add it to the set of editors. 
</p><p>
Another easy way to participate in Social Music Research is to just 
start tagging relevant web pages with the tag "SocialMusicResearch" on 
Delicious.  Elias talks about this on his <a href="https://mir-research.blogspot.com/">research blog</a>.

	<div class="entry-content">
				One of the things we've been working on this summer on Project Aura 
is a web application called The Music Explaura. The Explaura is designed
 to help people discover new music. One of the key features of the 
Explaura is that it offers transparent, steerable recommendations - you 
can ask the recommender why something was recommended, and you can steer
 the recommender toward music that you'll like.  If you like heavy metal
 music, but you don't like cookie monster vocals you can point the 
recommender in the right direction.  It's fun to play with and I've been
 finding lots of new music with it.  
<p>
All the cool bits in the user interface were implemented by our summer Über-intern <a href="http://www.francoismaillet.com/">Francois Maillet</a>.
 Francois will be demoing the interface during the Late Breaking/Demo 
session at ISMIR so if you are interested in seeing the Explaura in 
action be sure to stop by.

			<h3><a href="genius_or_savant_syndrome.html" title="permalink">How smart *is* the Genius?</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Here's a first look at the new Genius feature of iTunes 8.  First of
 all, there have been a few reports that the Genius feature will be '<a href="http://atlchris.com/250/is-itunes-genius-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-pandora/">Pandora-like</a>.'
 This is not true - the iTunes recommendations seem to be rather 
run-of-the-mill collaborative filtering recommendations based upon the 
wisdom of the crowds - as compared to the core technology behind Pandora
 which uses a detailed content-analysis of the music (by a trained staff
 of musicians) to generate recommendations.
<p>
So how are the Genius recommendations and playlists?  Well, there are 
some funny bits to start off with.  For instance, if try to get 
recommendations based upon a Beatles song, the 'Genius' can't help you 
at all.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_beatles-genius.png" alt="beatles-genius.png"><img src="support_files/_beatles-genius.png" alt="beatles-genius.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
Instead, it just falls back on what's popular.  It doesn't even try to 
match the Genre (britpop? 60s psychedelia) or artist (John Lennon, 
Wings?).  Pink and Rihanna are right out.  This glaring gap is not just 
confined to the Beatles, but it seems to occur for other artists like 
Bob Seger, and AC/DC that have shunned the iTunes store .
</p><p>
Similarly, for long tail artists, the Genius didn't have too much to 
say.  For example, the Genius recognized artist DJ Markitos and was 
ready to sell me another DJ Markitos album, but couldn't offer me any 
other recommendations:
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_markitos.png"><img src="support_files/_markitos.png" alt="markitos.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
When I avoid the long tail, or the iTunes-averse artists, I can coax the
 Genius to give me some real recommendations.  The first thing I notice 
is that the recommendations seem to be artist-based and not album or 
track-based.  For instance if I select as a seed track Emerson Lake and 
Palmer's 'Food for your Soul' (which is a big band jazz-fusion  track), I
 get recommendations for Yes, Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues, Procol 
Harem, and Renaissance. When I pick ELPs - Two Part Invention (Bach on a
 xylophone), I get the same recommendations for tracks by Yes, The Moody
 Blues, Procol Harem, Renaissace etc. And surprise, surprise, if I pick a
 progressive rock track by ELP I get recommendations for the same set of
 artists.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_elp-genius.png" alt="elp-genius.1.1.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" border="0">
</p><p>
The same is true for the playlists generated by the Genius - the Genius 
just picks tracks from similar artists regardless of how well the track 
is representative for the artist.  For instance, on the album 'Return to
 the center of the earth' by Rick Wakeman  the tracks alternate between 
music and narration.  If I use one of the narration tracks as a seed, 
the Genius gives me run of the mill tracks by progressive rock artists. 
No track-similarity is used to generate the playlists.  This is not 
Pandora-like behavior.
</p><p>
So, the Genius isn't great with the long tail, and can't give you good 
recommendations based upon a track or an album. So, how does it do with 
regular old recommendations? Let's look at a few:
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: Dazed and Confused by Led Zeppelin.
<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>: Spoon, RHCP, Pure Parie League, 
Chuck Berry, System of a Down, Madonna,  Linkin Park (the Chuck Berry 
song was the Christmas ditty'Run Rudolph Run')
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>I think we are seeing some extreme popularity bias here. The artists just don't match. 
<br><strong>My Score:</strong> D
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: My Name is Jonas by Weezer<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>: Audioslave, Death Cab For Cutie, blink-182, Tenacious D, Bright Eyes, Weezer, The Shins
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>No clunkers this time, but nothing new - no novelty or serendipity. I could get a much better list from All Music guide<br><strong>My Score:</strong> C
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: Fanfare for the Common Man by Emerson Lake and Palmer<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>: Yes, Focus, Genesis, The Moody Blues, Procol Harum
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>All recommendations from the progressive 
rock bands of the 70s. Again, no clunkers, but this list is not going to
 help people find new music - no Gentle Giant, no Porcupine Tree or 
Dream Theater.  This is classic rock radio<br><strong>My Score:</strong> C
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: Fidelity by Regina Spektor<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>:
 Ingrid Michaelson, Augustana, Lily Allen, Hellgoodbye, Mat Kearney, KT 
Tunstall, Corinne Baily Rae, Blue October, OK Go, Death Cab for Cutie, 
Gwen Stefani, Dashboard Confessional, Jason Mraz, John Mayer
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>Regina Spektor is a quirky indie 
singer-songwriter. One of these recommendations seem good to me: Ingrid 
Michaelson (hadn't heard of her, and she has that indie vibe), but the 
rest are just bad, (the Gwen Stefani recommendation is downright 
laughable). One good recommendation in ten - not too good<br><strong>My Score:</strong> D
</p><p>
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: Money by Pink Floyd<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>:
 Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Cream, ZZ Top, Pink Floyd, Deep 
Purple, Alice Cooper, Blue Oyster Cult, The Rolling Stones, Steppenwolf
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>Another set of artists from the greatest hits of the 60s and 70s album. Yawn<br><strong>My Score:</strong> D
</p><p>
I like to rate recommendations on 4 factors:
</p><ul>
<li> <strong>Relevance</strong> - how well do the recommended items 
match the taste - the genius does OK here, with a few glaring errors 
like the Gwen Stefani recommendation for Regina Spektor.
</li><li> <strong>Novelty</strong> - how well does the recommender find 
items that I haven't heard of - the Genus doesn't fair well at all - 
when it did recommend items that I hadn't heard of, they were almost 
always irrelevant.
</li><li> <strong>Reach</strong> - how far does the recommender get into
 the long tail. The Genius couldn't give recommendations for the long 
tail items that I tried, nor did it give recommendations that were far 
into the tail (and I couldn't steer it to hipster items).
</li><li> <strong>Transparency</strong> - how well does the recommender 
explain the recommendations.  A recommender like Pandora does a great 
job explaining why an item was recommended, however, the Genius doesn't 
even try to explain its recommendations.
</li></ul>
<p>
The iTunes Genius is just a run-of-the-mill collaborative filtering 
recommender - the recommendations are nothing special - there's no 
advanced content analysis like you get from <a href="http://www.musicip.com/">MusicIP</a>. There's no deep analysis of content and context like <a href="http://the.echonest.com/">The Echo Nest</a>.  There's no social community or tags like at <a href="https://last.fm/">Last.fm</a>. There's no transparency in the recommendations like at <a href="https://pandora.com/">Pandora</a>. - the Genius just gives rather pedestrian recommendations and playlists.  
</p><p>
Apple and iTunes are at a choke point in the music ecosystem - Apple has
 an opportunity to help people explore for and discovery new music. It 
is good to see Apple recognize this and at least start to provide 
recommendation tools. I hope they will start to look at all of the 
interesting work being done by researchers in the <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/">Recommenders</a> and <a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/">Music Information Retrieval</a> community and try to make their Genius a little smarter.

			<h3><a href="what_is_the_itunes_genius.html" title="permalink">What is the iTunes genius doing?</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				I've just upgraded to iTunes 8.0. I am eager to try out the new 
Genius feature (perhaps you didn't notice Steve Jobs mentioning it at 
the "Let's rock" announcement today).  When you enable the 'Genius' 
feature, iTunes asks you to agree to let iTunes send data about your 
iTunes library and your play history to the iTunes cloud. 
<p>
Once you agree, the Genius goes through a 3 step process 
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_genius-enrollment.png" alt="genius-enrollment.png" border="0">
</p><p>
I'm a bit puzzled about what the Genius is doing during this first step.
  I have about 10K songs in my iTunes library. The Genius took about a 
half hour to 'gather information' about my library. That's about 200 ms 
per track ... not enough time to do any kind of analysis (not even 
enough time to decode an MP3, let alone do any significant processing). 
 iTunes already has a database containing all the info it needs.  
Perhaps it is calculating an item-item similarity matrix for my artists,
 albums and tracks before it sends the data off too the cloud.  This 
would save Apple a lot of CPU cycles.
</p><p>
Once iTunes has finished gathering information about my library it sends
 it all to Apple and a few minutes later, Apple sends back my Genius 
results. Which means that I can now get recommendations for 
recommendations.

More about the recommendations in the next post.

				<p>BBC Radio labs has just launched <a href="http://www.radiopop.co.uk/" target="_blank">Radio Pop</a>
 - social listening for the BBC.&nbsp; With Radio Pop, your listening 
habits are scrobbled to the BBC - which will then show you all sorts of 
charts, graphs, and eight-by-ten colour glossy photographs with circles<span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span>and arrows about your listening habits (notice I used the British spelling of 'color').<br></p> 
  <p><a href="http://support_files/radiopop.png"><img src="support_files/radiopop.png"></a></p> 
  <p>Radio Pop is making the data that they collect available through an  <a href="http://www.radiopop.co.uk/api">API</a> so researchers and developers can play with the data and build new apps and websites around the data. </p> 
  <p>Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get the Radio Pop Player to 
work (the player is the thing that scrobbles your listening, and it 
doesn't seem to be mac-friendly), so I haven't been able to see how well
 it works or to play with&nbsp; the data yet.&nbsp; Still, I think this 
is a really interesting idea and I am eager to try it out when I can 
figure out how to scrobble my BBC listening.&nbsp; I've been really 
impressed about&nbsp; the folks at the BBC labs.&nbsp; They&nbsp; are 
thinking hard about how to bridge the divide between traditional radio 
and the social web.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there are lots of opportunities 
here - especially when you think of the social possibilities when 
millions of people are all listening to the same show.&nbsp; Read more 
at the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2008/09/radio_pop_social_radio_listeni.shtml">BBC Radio Labs blog</a>.</p>
