			<h2>A new way of selling music for independent artists ..</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<a target="_self" href="http://www.tunecore.com/">TuneCore</a> is a 
music delivery and distribution service that lets you put your music up 
for sale on iTunes and Rhapsody.&nbsp; For less than $10.00 you can get 
an album put on sale at iTunes for a year. You keep all of the rights 
and all of the profits from sale.&nbsp; Getting music in the stores has 
always been one of the biggest barriers for independents, but now with 
TuneCore, independents have a low cost way of getting their music in one
 of the <a target="_self" href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/1db3e1ee-7706-11da-a7d1-0000779e2340.html">largest music stores</a>
 in the world.&nbsp; Of course, distribution and sale is only one aspect
 of selling music. Independents still have to find a way to promote 
their music, to get it heard by people so new listeners will&nbsp; want 
to buy it.&nbsp; That's still something that they'll have to do on their
 own.<br><br>For iTunes and Rhapsody, being the main distribution point 
for independent music will be a key distinguishing feature over the 
every shrinking music department in the local WalMart.&nbsp; Offering 
10,000,000 or 100,000,000 different songs, including songs by the band 
that plays in the local eatery every friday night will drive new 
customers to the online store.&nbsp; The key problem, however,&nbsp; for
 the iTune and Rhapsody is to figure out how to&nbsp; drive people into <a target="_self" href="https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html">the long tail</a>, to find new music that they'll like.&nbsp; <br><br>Already,
 there has been quite a bit of effort made around social recommendation 
and collaborative filtering to help people find new music. <a href="https://last.fm/" target="_self">Last.fm</a>
 is one of the most successful examples of this.&nbsp; However, social 
recommendation suffers from a 'popularity bias'. Social systems tend to 
favor what is popular, so what is popular gets recommended more and 
becomes even more popular.&nbsp; It is hard for an unknown independent 
artist to make headway with this type of recommendation.&nbsp; That's 
where content-based recommendation can be helpful.&nbsp; Content-based 
systems recommend music based on 'what it sounds like',&nbsp; instead of
 'who is listening to it'. With a content-based recommender I can say 
'find me music that sounds like the song "Take five"' and I should get a
 list of recommendations or songs that sound similar.&nbsp; <br><br>Currently there are very few content-based recommendation engines.&nbsp; There's <a href="http://www.predixis.com/" target="_self">Predixis</a>, that uses automated, computer analysis to determine similarity and <a href="https://www.pandora.com/" target="_self">Pandora</a>
 that uses musicians to characterize music conent.&nbsp; It's still 
early days for content-based recommenders,&nbsp; and there's plenty of 
room for improvement in the quality of recommendations.&nbsp; I suspect,
 though that soon these content-based recommenders will be key to 
driving listeners into the long tail, to help people find that 
independent artist.<br><br>20 years ago a new artist needed a record 
company to be successful for three reasons: the recording studio, the 
record promotion and the distribution channel.&nbsp; Today, a recording 
studio is cheap and distribution is easy.&nbsp; The last piece of the 
puzzle is helping listeners find the new artist's music.<br><br>

                This statement is rather deceptive and technically 
untrue:

" You keep all of the rights and all of the profits from sale."

You get the net percentage that iTunes or Rhapsody has agreed with 
TuneCore to pay back from what they charge at retail.  Which their 
website doesn't actually specify that I can see.  I'd be surprised if 
its more then 20% of the sale price, but thats just random speculation.

You are also paying up front for them to "publish" you to iTunes and 
Rhpasody so you need to subtract that $10.00 from your "profit" to get 
your real profit or loss.

All in all it strikes me as very similar to "vanity publishing" in the 
book business.  You pay the costs to produce the IP.  You pay them to 
publish you. And then you pray you can sell enough to make it a net win.

                <p>Btw Im glad you mentioned the "last piece of the puzzle" but I think you didn't stress it strongly enough.
</p><p>"The last piece of the puzzle is helping listeners find the new 
artist's music." In other words, marketing. Without spending serious 
marketing dollars its doubtful you can find much of an audience.  And 
thats the bigget value the big publishers bring today.

                I'm not sure I agree about the content based 
recommenders being the solution to finding less popular artists. The 
problem being that finding a song that sounds like "Take Five" might get
 you another jazz track or another song in 5/4 time - but those probably
 aren't the reasons you think it is really good. That is a more 
undefinable quality.

I think maybe recommendations based on social groups of people 
interested in the same kind of music or based on "experts" (e.g. 
reviewers in the media or DJs even!) are going to be important in 
discovering new music.

Really interesting and relevant blog BTW.

                Tristanf ... thanks for the comments, I agree that 
content-based recommenders have lots of ground to cover before they can 
equal the quality of social recommenders, but content-based recommenders
 can do some things that a social recommender can't, such as figure out 
which of the 1,000 songs that were released *today* should be added to 
your regular rotation, or to generate a playlist of similar music on 
your iPod (when you are not connected to the social recommender).

(Btw, the audio tagger you describe at cookinrelaxin looks very 
interesting.)
