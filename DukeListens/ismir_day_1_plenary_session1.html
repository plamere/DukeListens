				<b> ISMIR Day 1 - Plenary Session 2 -- Music Recommendation and Recognition</b>
<p>
<a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/papers/ISMIR2008_157.pdf">A 
Comparison of Signal-Based Music Recommendation to Genre Labels, 
Collaborative Filtering, Musicological Analysis, Human Recommendation, 
and Random Baseline</a> by Terence Magno and Carl Sable
<br>
Terence describes 3 common recommendation strategies: Genre taxonomies, 
Musicological analysis, Collaborative Filtering and the pitfalls of 
these strategies (no surprises to regular readers of this blog).  
Terence goes on to describe their research with music similarity based 
upon content analysis.   They are using stock MIR techniques (MFCCs, 
GMMs, and similarity measures  like euclidean distance, EMD, etc).  
There goal is to tune the music similarity to match a human notion of 
similarity.
</p><p>
The two authors rated the similarity of 200 song pairs subjectively on a
 1-4 scale.  Then they tuned their similar model maximize the 
correlation with their subjective scale. This training set seems very 
small - using the opinions of only two researchers does not seem likely 
to be able to generate a general dataset useful as a ground truth for 
similarity.
</p><p>
They then conducted a small human evaluation (13 participants) and 
compared their result with AllMusic, Pandora, Last.fm and Random. This 
table shows the ranking (lower is better).

</p><p>
I wanted to ask a question about how the evaluation was conducted.  In 
particular I think it is important to note if the users were familiar 
with the recommended tracks or not, and whether or not during the 
evaluation could the participants listen to the music. One would expect 
that a good recommendation for a novel song would not be known by the 
participant - if they can't listen to the unknown recommendation they 
may rate the recommendation poorly.
</p><p>
The results don't agree with other comparisons I've seen between 
content-based and other recommendations strategy. I'm curious as to why.
 In my experience, content-based systems will perform significantly 
worse than these other systems when popular music is used.

<em><a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/papers/ISMIR2008_167.pdf">Development of An Automatic Music Selection System Based on Runner’s Step Frequency</a> </em>by
Masahiro Niitsuma, Hiroshi Takaesu, Hazuki Demachi, Masaki Oono and Hiroaki Saito
<br>
This paper presents an automated music selection system based upon a 
runner's step frequency.
They describe a preliminary study that concluded that people tend to 
feel comfortable with the BPM of a song matches their steps-per-minute 
when they are running.
</p><p>
Next they describe their system - first they estimate the running speed 
by looking at accelerometer data amd calculating the Steps per Minute 
from that data.  Next they group music based on its BPM.  Songs with 
similar BPMs (within 4 BPM) are clustered - then  they query the DB with
 runner's SPM and select one track from the corresponding group.
</p><p>
They evaluated the accuracy of the system and the user experience.  The 
user experience was improved when the step tracking system was used.

<em><a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/papers/ISMIR2008_199.pdf">A Robot Singer With Music Recognition Based on Real-Time Beat Tracking</a></em>

by Kazumasa Murata, Kazuhiro Nakadai, Kazuyoshi Yoshii, Ryu Takeda, 
Toyotaka Torii, Hiroshi G. Okuno, Yuji Hasegawa and Hiroshi Tsujino
</p><p>
Their goal is construct a robot singer that can detect musical beats by 
using its own ears and sing /scat/step according to the detected beat in
 real-time.
</p><p>
Challenges: robust to noise, adaptive to tempo changes, works in realtime.
</p><p> The author went on to describe how the system works and showed 
how their new beat tracker was able to more quickly identify tempo 
changes than previous systems.
</p><p>
The author showed a couple of videos showing a dancing robot that would 
adapt to songs with different tempos. Interesting and fun work. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
All in all a good session -- but it was a bit of an odd coupling of one paper on recommendation and two on music recognition.
