    One of the big problems faced by Music Information Retrieval researchers 
    is how to get good data for MIR experiments. Even a small scale music 
    classification experiment may require 10,000 songs. At $1 per song, that's 
    $10,000 just for the data for a small experiment. Experiments with larger 
    collections (100,000 to 1,000,000 songs) become impossible.

    </span>
<p align="left">
<span>
      The situation is about to get even worse. Soon, we may lose all 
      programmatic access to our music. As more digital music is sold (iTunes) 
      or rented (napster) more of our music is wrapped up in a DRM container. 
      The only thing we can do with such music is to play it with an 
      authorized player. Doing anything else with the bits is forbidden. Even 
      trying to get at the bits is forbidden thanks to the DMCA.
    </span>
</p>
<span>
    
</span>
<p align="left">
<span>
      There are lots of things music consumers could do with the bits: music 
      similarity classification, beat and tempo detection, cross fading from 
      one song to another. There are many more things that MIR researchers can 
      do with the bits. All will be lost if all of the bits are taken away 
      from us. Our music will become 'listen-only'.
    </span>
</p>
<span>
    
</span>
<p align="left">
<span>
      The fight for the bits is not over yet. There are some who are pushing 
      for a sane DRM policy that protects IP but also promotes innovation and 
      ensures access. Sun's <a href="http://research.sun.com/people/mybio.php?uid=84464" shape="rect">Susan 
      Landau</a> is on the frontlines in the DRM policy battle. Susan gave a 
      talk at the recent Sun Labs Open House called: <a href="http://research.sun.com/sunlabsday/talks.php?id=64" shape="rect">Rocky 
      Shoals and Bright Lights: DRM Directions</a> that describes a "DRM 
      policy direction that is a win/win/win for consumers, for technology 
      developers, for content producers -- and for the Internet and society".

    I was starting to look around for a client side blog editor. I was getting 
    tired of typing html tags all of the time. It seemed that all of the 
    really cool client side blog editors required a Mac. Well, that wouldn't 
    do for me. But today I found out that BlogEd has received a major 
    facelift. I'm using it right now to create this entry. I can do all the 
    formatting tricks such as:

    </span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>
        Create a numbered list
      </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>
        Put things in <b>bold </b>
      
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>
        Put things in <i>italics </i><font color="#ff33ff">and color</font>
      
</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>
        I can easily put in things like the Java<sup>TM</sup> platform with 
        superscripts

      For the Search Inside the Music Demo, I wanted to be able to visualize 
      the music space by showing a plot of the music space. I looked at a 
      number of charting packages for Java and settled on <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/" shape="rect">JFreeChart</a>. 
      JFreeChart is a free (LGPL) chart library that supports a large number 
      of chart types from pies, bars, lines and scatter plots. The JFreeChart 
      API is quite flexible. I was able to easily wrap my code around a 
      JFreeChart to make the charts interactive. Here's an example of a 
      visualization of the music space that shows a musical journey from one 
      style of music to another. All using JfreeChart:

<a href="http://www.listen.com/" shape="rect">Rhapsody</a> joined 
      Napster this week in offering a "to go" service that will allow 
      subscribers to move their songs onto <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1027_3-5183692.html?tag=nefd_lede" shape="rect">Janus</a>-compatible 
      devices. For $15 per month, Rhapsody customers can load up their 
      portable players with as many songs as they want (and will fit) in a 
      month. As long as they pay their bill they have access to the entire 
      Rhapsody catalog on their device ... but when they stop paying the 
      monthly fee, all the songs go away. Currently there are only three 
      Janus-compatible devices listed on the Rhapsody site: the iriver h10, 
      the creative Zen Micro and the Dell DJ.

      I'm a regular reader of <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/" shape="rect">The 
      Register</a> so I was quite pleased to see this extensive coverage of 
      the Sun Labs Open House. Correspondent Andrew Orlowski took a tour of 
      labs and offers highlights in the article <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/05/02/inside_sun_labs/" shape="rect">Inside 
      Sun Labs</a>. Mr Orlowski offers this observation about the <i>Search 
      inside the Music</i> project:
    </span>
</p>
<span>
    
</span>
<p>
<span>
      
    
</span>
</p>
<span>
    
</span>
<ul></ul>
<span>
    The psychological insight necessary to produce a divine playlist doesn't 
    come from an algorithm, or even an encyclopedic knowledge of music, but 
    from experience and understanding. I must say that I agree with Mr. 
    Orlowski wholeheartedly. A divine playlist (or even a not-that-bad 
    playlist) can have the subtlety and nuance of a poem. Musical themes, 
    lyrical themes, mood, instrumentation, rhythm and tempo can interact as 
    one song leads into another. A good playlist is its own art form. A visit 
    to <a href="http://www.artofthemix.org/index.asp" shape="rect">The Art of 
    the Mix</a> demonstrates that the art form is alive and well.

    </span>
<p>
<span>
      But just because a computer can't generate a divine playlist doesn't 
      mean that it can't greatly improve upon "iTunes' lamentable Party 
      Shuffle". The problem I'm (and many others in the MIR community are) 
      trying to solve is how to deal with a million song iPod. Shuffle play 
      won't scale, and there aren't any DJs waiting to program my tastes into 
      the proper playlist poetry. I'd much rather have a million song iPod 
      that could generate a playlist that at least contains songs that I like, 
      even if they aren't in the divine order.

      One of the interesting things about giving a technology demo such as 
      "search inside the music" is that you are exposing a whole lot of folks 
      to technology that they haven't seen (or heard) before. Folks sometimes 
      assume that what they are seeing is all new technology.
    </span>
</p>
<span>
    
</span>
<p>
<span>
      While there is lots of new and interesting technology in the 'search 
      inside the music' demo, there are also some technologies that have been 
      explored previously by a number of researchers in the Music Information 
      Retrieval (MIR) community. Some of the most interesting and directly 
      related work is the work by Logan, Ellis and Berenzweig summarized on 
      Dan Ellis's <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/%7Edpwe/research/musicsim/" shape="rect">Music 
      Similarity</a> page, and the work by George Tzanetakis on <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Egtzan/papers/thesis.html" shape="rect">Manipulation, 
      Analysis and Retrieval Systems for Audio Signals</a>.

      The <a href="http://ismir2004.ismir.net/" shape="rect">International 
      Symposium of Music Information Retrieval</a> (ISMR) has a good 
      collection of papers (although their site seems to be down as I write 
      this) about music classification based upon similarity. Likewise, the <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/" shape="rect">music-ir.org</a> 
      site provided by Dr. Stephen Downie is an excellent starting point for 
      those who are interested in learning more about music information 
      retrieval.

      One of the downsides of the Sun Labs open house is that I'm so busy 
      giving demos and talks that I can't attend any of the other talks. One 
      talk in particular that I was hoping to see was Guy Steele's talk on <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/plrg/fortress0618.pdf" shape="rect">Fortress</a>. 
      Fortress promises to <i>Do for Fortran what Java did for C</i>. In

      When I'm working closely with a Java API, I will usually find myself, 
      sooner or later, digging into the API source code (if it is available) 
      to see how a feature really works. This usually means finding the 
      separate source download (or even configuring CVS to pull the code from 
      some repository someplace). A pain in the neck to say the least, but the 
      code provides the definitive description of what is going on, so 
      sometimes it's worth it. However, all the pain of finding, downloading, 
      unpacking and browsing the source can be eliminated.
    </span>

<span>
      Since version 1.4, JavaDoc has included a '-linksource' option that will 
      automatically create an HTML version of each source file and link it 
      into the normal documentation. With the -linksource option, the class 
      and method names in the docs will contain links to the source code. When 
      browsing docs built with the -linksource option, I don't have to break 
      away from the docs to find the corresponding source file, it is all 
      right there in the docs. For an example of how this work check out the <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/javadoc/" shape="rect">JFreeChart 
      API</a> docs.

      Group defining the next generation of the Java Speech API. The 
      specification is now in public review. If you have an interest speech on 
      the Java platform take a look at the <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=113" shape="rect">specification</a>

          I'm currently reading the excellent book <i>Freedom of Expression: 
          Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity</i> by 
          Kembrew McLeod. The overarching theme is how current copyright law 
          has been taken over by corporate types and instead of promoting the 
          creation of new work, stifles it. Here's an excerpt about what 
          happened to the Verve when they sampled 5 notes from a Rolling 
          Stones song:

          </span>
<ul>
<quote></quote>
</ul>
<span>
          
<i>The Verve, a popular British band that scored a major worldwide 
          hit in 1997 with “Bittersweet Symphony.” The Verve negotiated a 
          license to use a five-note sample from an orchestral version of one 
          of the Rolling Stones’ lesser hits, “The Last Time,” and received 
          clearance from Decca Records. After “Bittersweet Symphony” became a 
          hit single, the group was sued by former Stones manager Allen Klein 
          (who owns the copyrights to the band’s pre-1970 songs because of 
          aggressive business practices). He claimed the Verve broke the 
          agreement when they supposedly used a larger portion than was 
          covered in the license, something the group vehemently disputed. </i>

          
</span>
<p>
<span>
            
<i>The Verve layered nearly fifty tracks of instrumentation, 
            including novel string arrangements, to create a distinctly new 
            song. In fact, the song’s signature swirling orchestral melody was 
            recorded and arranged by the Verve; the sample from the 
            instrumental record is largely buried under other tracks in the 
            chorus. The band eventually settled out of court and handed over 
            100 percent of their songwriting royalties because it seemed 
            cheaper than fighting for a legal ruling that might not end in 
            their favor. As if things couldn’t have gotten worse, they were 
            then sued by another old Rolling Stones manager, Andrew Loog 
            Oldham. Klein went after the Verve for infringing on the 
            songwriting copyright, which he owned, but Oldham possessed the 
            copyright on the sampled sound recording. They totally lost 
            everything. </i>
          
</span>
</p>
<span>
          
</span>
<p>
<span>
            
<i>Not only couldn’t the Verve earn money from their biggest hit, 
            they were stripped of control of their song. For instance, after 
            the group refused Nike’s request to use “Bittersweet Symphony” in 
            an ad, the shoe manufacturer aired the song after it purchased a 
            license from Allen Klein. “The last thing in the world I wanted 
            was for one of my songs to be used in a commercial,” the 
            despondent lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft said. “I’m still sick 
            about it.” In one final kick in the groin, “Bittersweet Symphony” 
            was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Song category, which honors 
            songwriters. Because the unfavorable settlement transferred the 
            Verve’s copyright and songwriting credit to Klein and the Rolling 
            Stones, the Grammy nomination went to “Mick Jagger and Keith 
            Richards.” Ashcroft quipped that it was “the best song Jagger and 
            Richards have written in twenty years.” He then suffered from a 
            nervous breakdown and the group broke up. </i>

				<p>
Starting in 1989 when my first child was born I stopped listening to new music. It was replaced by the likes of Raffi and <a href="http://www.steveblunt.com/">Steve Blunt</a>.
 I missed about 15 years of music (which gets a bit embarassing, such as
 when someone mentions 'beck' and I'd start talking about jeff beck, not
 even considering the notion that they'd be talking about another 
'beck'). Now I'm trying to make up for this lost decade and a half. I've
 been trying to expand my musical horizons.   
</p><p>
A little while ago, <a href="http://www.webmink.net/">Simon Phipps</a> pointed me toward <a href="http://radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a>
 a streaming internet radio station.  They have a great mix of new and 
old music.    RP is like old time radio in that they have DJs that think
 about how songs fit together and flow smoothly between genres. Also, 
listeners can rate songs which affect the playlists. Here's the playlist
 for the last hour or so:
</p><pre>4:09 am - Yo La Tengo - Autumn Sweater
4:06 am - Blood Oranges - Bridges
4:02 am - Malcolm Holcombe - Goin' Home
3:59 am - Tom Waits - Long Way Home
3:54 am - The BoDeans - Good Things
3:51 am - Mazzy Star - Halah
3:46 am - Cranberries - When You're Gone
3:41 am - Zero 7 - Give It Away
3:37 am - REM - Try Not To Breathe
3:30 am - King Crimson - The Power To Believe II
3:25 am - Mark Knopfler - What It Is
3:20 am - Calexico - Quattro (World drifts in)
3:16 am - Santana - El Farol
</pre>

It's all good stuff. I'm listening to artists that I've never heard 
before.  If I hear something I really like I can click on the 'now 
playing' link and find out more about the artist (or buy the CD from 
Amazon).  I'm starting to get an idea of what happened musically in the 
90s, and what's going on today too.

				I was ripping all my CDs into OGG format - they sounded good, and 
the file size was small. However, when I got a portable MP3 player that 
didn't support OGG format I had to convert them all to MP3s.  Instead of
 re-ripping, I converted the OGGs to MP3s (I know, audio purists shudder
 at such a thought). Only later after I had deleted all of the OGGs did I
 realize that the tags identifying artist, album and title didn't get 
added to the MP3s. I had thousands of MP3s with no MP3 ID tags.  Arghh! 
 
<p>
Faced with the prospect of re-ripping hundreds of CDs, I set out in 
search of an automatic MP3 tagger.  After looking at a number of them I 
settled on <a href="http://entagged.sourceforge.net/">Entagged - the Musical Box</a>.  I like entagged for a number of reasons:
</p><ul>
<li><p>
Written in Java, so it runs on Linux and Solaris
</p>
</li><li><p>
Interacts with FreeDB to grab album/artist and genre info
</p>
</li><li><p>
It is open source
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
If you are looking for an MP3 tagger, I'd recommend entagged.

One of the difficulties with building a Music Information Retrieval 
system is acquiring enough music data for training and testing of the 
system.   Music publishers hold the IP of the music very tightly which 
makes it difficult for MIR researchers to use and share their music. If I
 have published some MIR research results using a body of 5,000 songs 
and you want to repeat the experiment and duplicate the results you will
 have to build up the identical 5,000 song collection on your own.  This
 is unlike other disciplines: Text retrieval folks can use <a href="http://trec.nist.gov/">Text Retrieval Conference</a> (trec) data, speech researchers can use the extensive data provided by the <a href="http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/">Linguistic Data Consortium</a>.  There is currently no equivalent resource for music resources.
</p><p>
 The <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/evaluation/">International Music Information Retrieval Systems Evaluation Laboratory</a>
 (IMIRSEL) Project, is an attempt to rectify this problem by providing a
 standard set of evaluations and a common set of music data for MIR 
researchers to use.  Dr. Downie and his team are working hard to 
establish this as the 'TREC' of Music Information Retrieval.  They have 
just released <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/evaluation/m2k/index.html">M2K</a> which will serve as the MIR evaluation framework for this year's <a href="http://ismir2005.ismir.net/">ISMIR</a> (the International Conference on Music Information Retrieval).  The IMIRSEL looks to be a great resource for MIR researchers.  
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the IMIRSEL doesn't offer any music data collections as 
of yet so researchers have to look elsewhere for music data. One 
excellent source of music data is <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune.com</a>,
 the open source record label.  Magnatune makes available for download 
over 350 albums by nearly 200 artists, for a total of nearly 5,000 songs
 spanning all genres. The music is licensed under the creative commons 
license which means that non-commercial use of their music is free.  The
 128 bit encoded MP3 files  are consistently tagged with genre 
information making them great for a number of MIR tasks such as artist 
classification, genre classification and music similarity (and the music
 sounds good too!).  Until the IMIRSEL is fully established, Magnatune 
may be the best place to find good data for MIR research.
