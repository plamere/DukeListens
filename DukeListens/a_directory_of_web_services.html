<span style="font-style: italic;">(Most recent update: May 24, 2006)</span><br><br>
In this 'web 2.0' world, people like to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_%28web_application_hybrid%29" target="_self">mashups</a> by making a web app that combines the data of two or more web services (note this shouldn't be confused with <a href="http://www.paintingbynumbers.com/bootcamp/" target="_self">music mashups</a>).&nbsp; There are plenty of
music sites out there that provide public APIs that can be used for all
sorts of purposes (for MIR researchers looking for music data, for web
2.0 developers trying to make the next killer music app, or&nbsp; the
hobbyist, just for doing fun things).&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some of my favorites:<br><br><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/102-5853592-4099315?node=3435361" target="_self">Amazon web services -</a>
a great place to go to collect all sorts of music metadata, including
album art, editorial and customer reviews, track lists, popularity,
similar items, release dates and all that.&nbsp; It is possible to
crawl through the amazon catalog and collect information on thousands
and thousands of CDs (and books and DVDs for that matter) in the course
of a week or so (Amazon does request that you limit your requests to no
more than one per second).</li><li><a href="http://mobdev.pbwiki.com/" target="_self">MusicMobs</a>
- MusicMobs is playlist sharing and social tagging / recommendation
music site.&nbsp; The site is built entirely on top of its&nbsp; public
webservices API. This means that anything that MusicMobs can do with
their data, you can do to. The have services for getting playlists,
finding&nbsp; info about different artists, exploring the social tags
applied by users.&nbsp; The documentation is not necessarily up-to-date
but Toby (the site operator) is always ready to help.</li><li><a href="http://www.musicstrands.com/" target="_self">MusicStrands</a> -&nbsp; MusicStrands is a social recommendation / discovery site.&nbsp; They've just released their first public version of <a href="http://www.musicstrands.com/openstrands/overview.vm" target="_self">OpenStrands,</a>
their web services API. This API includes catalog, recommendation
playlist, tagging and community services (and it's free to registered
users).</li><li><a href="https://www.last.fm/" target="_self">last.fm</a>
- last.fm is probably the 'king' of the social recommenders out
there.&nbsp; Last.fm (via AudioScrobbler) provides an API for
getting user, artist, tag and group data.&nbsp; Here's an example of
using the <a href="https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/Metallica/similar.xml" target="_self">similar artists service</a>.</li><li><a href="https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/XMLWebService" target="_self">MusicBrainz</a>
- MusicBrainz is a community music metadatabase. They provide web&nbsp;
services for all of the information in the database including artists,
albums and tracks. MusicBrainz establishes a unique MusicBrainz ID for
each track in its database (using MusicDNS fingerprinting technology).</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.musicdns.org/" target="_self">MusicDNS</a> -&nbsp; which is run MusicIP (formerly Predixis)&nbsp; provides a music fingerprinting service that works with MusicBrainz.<br>
  </li>
<li><a href="http://rws-blog.rhapsody.com/rhapsody_web_services/" target="_self">Rhapsody.com</a>
- Rhapsody is a music subscription service. The provide a number of RSS
feeds that report top artists and albums as well as new releases, links
to album art, track IDs (useful for playing the audio)</li><li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/entry/webjay.org/api/help" target="_self">WebJay</a>&nbsp;
(now part of yahoo). A playlist sharing site.&nbsp; Webjay provides
APIs for creating, modifying and retrieving playlists.</li><li><a href="http://aol.musicnow.com/media/developer/index.htm" target="_self">AOL Music</a>- AOL music provides RSS feeds for their 'charts' such as the top songs, aritst, albums and playlists.</li><li><a href="http://mp3tunes.com/api" target="_self">Mp3Tunes</a>
 - Mp3Tunes is a music locker, a place for people to store their music 
online so they can access it anywhere (at home, at work, on vacation), 
without needing to carry it.&nbsp; They also have an index of about 
50,000 songs that are freely available on the net (called <a href="http://www.sideload.com/" target="_self">sideload.com).</a>&nbsp; The API allows for the syncing and streaming of music (to and from the locker). <span style="font-style: italic;">Added 5/24/06.</span><br></li></ul>There
are some notable music sites that don't provide web services are
iTunes, Pandora, Yahoo Music, and All Music. It is great to see so many
of the next generate music discovery
services embracing open APIs.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see what
interesting mashups result from these systems.<br>

                Thanks for the mention Paul! Also, I know you've covered
 some of it before, but if anyone is interested in sample Musicmobs API 
applications they should take a look at some of the great work <a href="http://andrewhitchcock.org/" rel="nofollow">Andrew Hitchcock</a> has done:

                Pandora does have an API there's an invisible flash 
applet that can be used to pull information from. That's what the new 
version of PandoraFM uses. There's no hacks on the new version.

                Speaking of Music Mashups...

Hi, my name is Gideon, I'm the owner and admin of <a href="http://www.artistserver.com/" rel="nofollow">ArtistServer.com</a> 

I have a nice music and map mashup on ArtistServer you may want to check out:

<a href="http://www.artistserver.com/map.cfm" rel="nofollow">ArtistServer.com/map.cfm</a>
 

I've geocoded the 4,500+ artists on my site down to their city, and have
 integrated with Yahoo maps to provide an interesting way to browse for 
music.

You can select a genre on the left, and it will load an overlay of 
artists who create music in that genre. Next, click on the headphone 
icons on the map to view an artists. And finally, you are show the songs
 by that artist in the selected genre.

In otherwords, you can browse Earth by musical genre.

I've also embeded a chat window above the map so site visitors can 
browse in parallel and talk about what they've found.

ArtistServer.com's API is also under development. I currently provide 
RSS feeds to most of my data, but will have some other areas open up 
later this year. For example, I've started a 'widget' API - which will 
allow people to generate and embed site widgets containing music or 
ringtones from ArtistServer.

BTW - you may want to add AOL to your list of music APIs, they released 
an API for Music Now: <a href="http://aol.musicnow.com/media/developer/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Music Now API</a>

Hasta,
Gideon Marken
