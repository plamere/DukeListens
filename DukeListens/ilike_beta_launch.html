			<h2>iLike beta launch - a review</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				
Last night at 10pm, <a href="http://ilike.com/" target="_self">iLike</a> launched their beta. iLike is a social music discovery service funded by Sun founder Vinod Khosla.&nbsp; <br><br>iLike, like other social music sites such as <a href="https://last.fm/" target="_self">last.fm</a>
 has a substantial web presence as well as an iTunes plugin.&nbsp; The 
iTunes plugin runs as an iTunes 'drawer' a sidebar that adds iLike 
context information such as information about 'related artists' as well 
as info about your iLike 'friends'<br><br><img src="support_files/tour1.jpg"><br><br>When
 you play songs in itunes, info shows up in the iLike sidebar.&nbsp; For
 instance, if the 'Related' artist tab is selected, when you play a song
 by Death Cab for Cutie, you'll see songs by artists such as the Postal 
Service, ColdPlay and The Shins in the 'related artists' tab.<br><br>I 
found the 'related artists' to be more than a bit disappointing.&nbsp; 
To me, the purpose of a 'related artists' recommender is to help me find
 music that I don't know about that is similar to what I'm listening to 
now.&nbsp; The iLike 'related artists' falls short in a few ways.&nbsp; 
First, the recommendations are artist related, not song related, so no 
matter what song I play by an artist I'm given the same 
recommendations.&nbsp; If I play the Beatles 'Helter Skelter' or 
'Michele' - I get the same recommendations although they are very 
different songs.&nbsp; Second, the recommendations for the most part 
were completely obvious.&nbsp; I like it best when a recommender gives 
me some recommendations from artists that I've not heard of before, but 
the iLike recommendations were (with some notable exception - see 
below), were so predictable it was as if they were scraped from the <a href="http://allmusic.com/" target="_self">All Music Guide</a> related artists.&nbsp; <br>Here's a set of recommendations received.<br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Seed Artist</span> <br></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recommendation</span> <br></td>
</tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Led Zeppelin<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Pink Floyd, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, AC/DC, Black Sabbath<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Beatles<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Pink Floyd, Radiohead, U2, The Rolling Stones<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Weezer<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Green Day, Foo Fighters, Jimmy Eat World, Nirvana, The Beatles<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Johnny Cash<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Willie Nelson, Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Fiona Apple<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan, Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Norah Jones<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Yes<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Rush, Genesis, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Kansas</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>I did get a clunker recommendation however.&nbsp; When I was playing
 Emerson, Lake and Palmer's Karn Evil 9 - a progressive rock masterpiece
 -&nbsp; I was given the recommendation 'Grandma Got Run over by a 
reindeer' by Elmo &amp; Patsy, as well as 4 other christmas songs.&nbsp;
 Clearly outside the realm of a reasonable recommendation.&nbsp; iLike 
promises that their recommendations will get better as they get more 
users. That's the classic social recommender cold-start problem - you 
need lots of users to get good recommendations, but in early days, 
before you have lots of users, you'll generate crappy recommendations. 
I'm sure their recommendations will get better - and I hope that 
eventually they can tell me things that I don't already know - maybe a 
NiN recommendation for that Johnny Cash fan once in a while.<br><br>iLike&nbsp;
 also offers a set of 'free music by new artists' in the 'related' 
panel.&nbsp; I found the music to interesting, but generally not very 
well related to the seed artist. Again, probably a symptom of the 
cold-start problem.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is a good source of free 
indie music - I downloaded the song 'Sad Reminders' by 'the Winter 
Sounds' - funny thing was that iLike couldn't find any related music to 
this song - iLike recommended this song since it was related to some 
Pink Floyd that I was listening to, but when I was listening to the 
song, iLike didn't seem to know anything about it.<br><br>If you go to 
your iLike home page on the web, iLike will give you another more 
detailed set of music recommendations.&nbsp; This, for me, was a mix of 
free mp3s as well as songs I could buy at iTunes.&nbsp; The top 
recommendation was ... you guessed it ... 'Grandma got run over by a 
reindeer'.&nbsp; It would be nice if iLike could tell me why they are 
recommending a particular song (much like Amazon or Pandora do).&nbsp; 
Words like "We are recommending 'Grandma got run over by a reindeer' 
because you like annoyingly-cute christmas songs'."&nbsp; Or .. "We are 
recommending 'Grandma got run over by a reindeer' because it is similar 
to Emerson Lake and Palmer's opus about nuclear armageddon." would be 
helpful.<br><br>iLike uploads your iTunes play history to the iLife 
server, and makes this visible to all.&nbsp; If you are a privacy 
fanatic (or even just slightly concerned about privacy), this may be a 
bit disconcerting.&nbsp; For instance, you can look at my music play 
history here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ilike.com/user/Paul_L2" target="_self">http://www.ilike.com/user/Paul_L2</a>.&nbsp; I took a quick browse through the <a href="http://www.ilike.com/user" target="_self">iLike users</a> - its a who's who of music discovery - there's Tom, CTO of Pandora, a whole gaggle of the last.fm crew, Toby from musicmobs, <a href="http://netblogsrocknroll.com/" target="_self">Mr. DJ Alchemi</a>
 and others. (BTW, Does DJ really want us to know that his #2 song of 
all time is "Can't get you out of my head " by Kylie Minogue?)<br><br>Probably
 the neatest thing that iLike has to offer is the ability to browse 
through other people's music history - this harkens back to the day of 
the original napster - where you could browse through the music 
collections of thousands of people.&nbsp; Of course, the difference is 
that unlike napster, when you are browsing you can listen to 30 second 
low quality clip, but you can't download the song without forking over 
$.99 to iTunes.&nbsp; iLike does have a neat compatibility score. When 
you are browsing through another listener's collection - you are shown a
 score that shows how well matched your music collections are.&nbsp; 
iLike touts this ability to browse through other people's collections as
 one of their key differentiators - but last.fm has been doing this for 
quite some time - here's my listening history on last.fm:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.last.fm/users/lamere" target="_self">http://www.last.fm/users/lamere</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Growing Pains - </span>iLike
 is a beta and as such there were a few snags here and there.&nbsp; When
 I first installed iLike, the sidebar drawer was all scrambled. It 
looked like all of the tabbed panels in the sidebar were visible at the 
same time.&nbsp; A restart of iTunes seemed to fix that.&nbsp; Another 
glitch - if I'm listening to a song in iTunes, and then click on a song 
in someone's collection to preview it, the iTunes song doesn't stop 
playing - so I end up hearing two songs at the same time.&nbsp; Hey, but
 this is a beta, so I'm sure these things will be fixed in no time.<br><br>So here's a rundown of what iLike does:<br><ul><li>Adds an iTunes plugin that uploads your play history</li><li>Gives somewhat obvious related artist recommendations</li><li>Offers a set of song recommendations<br></li><li>Lets you find other users like yourself</li><li>Lets you browse the music collections of others</li><li>Give you recommendations for 'related' free-to-download music</li></ul>I
 think iLike has done well on execution. The web site and the plugin are
 quite slick - and eye-friendly - but so far, I haven't seen them do 
anything that isn't already being done by other social sites such as <a href="https://last.fm/" target="_self">last.fm</a>.&nbsp;
 They don't do social tagging. They don't do playlist generation.&nbsp; 
They don't offer music charts.&nbsp; They don't expose any of their data
 with a web services API.&nbsp; You can only listen to 30 second music 
clips. Like <a href="http://qloud.com/" target="_self">QLoud,</a> they 
are suffering from the cold-start problem - until they get a large 
enough user base they'll continue to recommend 'Grandma got run over by a
 reindeer' to progressive rock fans.&nbsp; Like QLoud, I don't think 
excellent execution is going to let them catch up to last.fm - with its 
deep set of social data.&nbsp; Still, it is just a beta, iLike has good 
funding, an it looks like they have an&nbsp; excellent technical and 
management team, so I'm sure iLike will be doing some interesting, 
innovative things in the music discovery space soon. They certainly bear
 watching.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Update - I <span style="font-weight: bold;">am</span> having fun with iLike - browsing through other people's music tastes is interesting and somewhat addictive.</span><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                Paul, I refuse to feel the shame you apparently think I 
should for liking &lt;em&gt;Can't Get You Out of My Head&lt;/em&gt; ;-) 
it's a cracking pop song. Besides I have plenty more embarrassing stuff 
in my collection (see my <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/davidjennings/" rel="nofollow">last.fm charts</a>, for example.<br><br>

Thanks for the useful overview. I will have a proper look at iLike when I have time.

                Well, the ELP == Christmas phenomenon has got to be from
 the synecdochic fallacy that the group is defined by "I Believe in 
Father Christmas," and sounds like more evidence the database it's 
dealing with is a bit thin. Thanks for the review, Paul... it's a sign 
for me to stay away for the moment.

                I just tried iLike, and it *does* have a playlist 
generator - it doesn't have it on the Macintosh yet, but on Windows it 
makes one-click playlists, as easily as Pandora but instead using the 
music in your own iTunes. If you haven't tried it out on Windows you're 
missing out

                Paul, thanks for doing the job ... I am still on my way 
with last.fm despite that I have been in the MIR / recommendation 
business on my own (shame on me!), do you know if there is somebody else
 out there who did a comparison of pandora, last.fm and the new and 
upcoming stuff ... ? yes I am lazy, no my workload is just to heavy to 
spend enough time on this beloved topic .. thanks again!
