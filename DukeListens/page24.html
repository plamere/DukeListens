				<p>Last month, I wrote about what I thought were the 4 things that 
Amazon needed to do to be a serious competitor to iTunes.&nbsp; Well, 
the beta version of the Amazon.com store is here.&nbsp; So lets see how 
they did.&nbsp; <br></p><ul><li><b>Work seamlessly with the iPod&nbsp;</b>
- If I, (or more importantly, a non-digital-music guru), can't get the
music from the Amazon store onto their nano or their shuffle, then the
store is a non-starter. <b>How they did:&nbsp; </b><b>A</b> - they have a
 tag-along app that will move your Amazon purchases into iTunes for you.
 (I haven't tried it yet, as I am linux-bound all week, but I hear that 
it works well)<br></li><li><b>Broad and Deep Catalog - </b>The Amazon bookstore is a poster child for the long tail - they better do the same for music. <b>How they did</b>&nbsp; <b>C-&nbsp; </b>The
 Amazon store has "over 2 million tracks" which doesn't compare well 
with iTunes which currently claims 6 million tracks. &nbsp; <br></li><li><b>DRM-Free</b> - Rumor is that Amazon is doing the right thing here ... no DRM for their tracks.<b> How they did: A+&nbsp; </b>DRM-free MP3 tracks&nbsp; - with 256k vbr encoding&nbsp; for $.89. Very nice.<br></li><li><b>Discovery and Recommendation - </b>Amazon
is well known for its recommendation and personalization technologies.&nbsp;
If they can make it as easy to find new music as they make it finding
new books then Jeff may give Steve a run for his money.&nbsp; <b>How they did: Incomplete -&nbsp; </b>they
 are doing recommendations based on my previous purchases, but when I 
try to get recommendations for 'new music' or 'soon to be released' 
music - I'm told that Amazon has no recommendations for me, and they 
just give me the 'Top Sellers'&nbsp; - I expect Amazon to do better than
 that, much better!<br></li></ul><p>&nbsp;
One nice surprise: Variable pricing - there are many tracks and albums 
the sell for lower than the $.89. For instance you can get a DRM-free 
MP3 version of Pink Floyd's "Wish you were here" for $5.60. That's a 
great deal for&nbsp; a super album.</p><p><b>Overall</b> : With their 'beta' label, Amazon is expecting an '<b>Incomplete'</b>
 grade here.&nbsp; If they fill out their catalog and raise the quality 
of the recommendations to the level of their book recommendations, they 
should be able to get that incomplete turned into an <b>A.</b><br></p>

Amazon knows about me, it was able to make recommendations right away 
based on my several hundred previous (mostly non-music) purchases.&nbsp;
 The recommendations seemed to be pretty good. I purchased KT Tunstualls

 a track from the Amazon store was incredibly easy. Amazon already has

 my 5 minute look at the Amazon store, so far it looks pretty 
good.&nbsp; They really could give iTunes a run for their money.&nbsp; I
 know I shall be shopping there for music before I go to iTunes.<br><br></p>

Sunday was Day 0 of ISMIR - the tutorial day before the main conference 
starts.  Oscar and I gave our music recommendation tutorial in the 
afternoon.  It was well attended, people seemed to enjoy it and had nice
 things to say after (but really, does anyone ever have anything bad to 
say?). I  would have liked to attend some of the other tutorials, but I 
was too busy prepping for  our tutorial.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day they had a wine reception with oodles of local 
wines to sample. It was a great introduction to the wine culture in 
Vienna.

After a nap to make up for a sleepless redeye, I took a stroll through 
Vienna.  I headed over to the TUV,  where the conference is hosted - no 
one was there ... so I just wandered from there up the main shopping 
street to St. Stephens.  There was a clown festival, I've seen more than
 my share of adult men with red balls on their noses today.  After the 
walk, I figured out how to use the subway and made it back to the hotel 
without getting lost.  Not to shabby.  In a few minutes I'll be back out
 again heading to dinner - then (hopefully) a good night sleep, since I 
have a lot of talking to do tomorrow at the music recommendation 
tutorial.

I had to make sure that the camera/laptop/flickr connection was working 
before I hop on the plane to Vienna, so I took this picture of some of 
my favorite MIR-related books.  I haven't read 'The Influentials' yet, 
but it does look interesting and relevant to music recommendations, 
tastemakers and trendsetters.<br>
<br>
Oh, and if you are taking pictures at ISMIR, be sure to upload them to 
Flickr and tag them with ismir2007, so we can have a shared photo 
gallery.  (There are about 100 shots on flickr from <a href="https://flickr.com/search/?q=ismir2006&amp;s=int">ISMIR 2006</a>).

Gregorian Chant' by Benedictine Monks, iTunes is recommending Green Day,
 Interpol, The Mars Volta, Velvet Revolver Joni Mitchell, and Amy 
Winehouse.  Me thinks they are having a bit of a sparse data issue here.
  Not enough people have listened to Gregorian chants to allow iTunes to
 tap into the wisdom of the crowds.

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>On the <a href="https://mir-research.blogspot.com/2007/09/mirex-results-online.html">MIR Research blog</a>, Elias points out that the team that organizes <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/mirex2007/index.php/MIREX2007_Results">MIREX</a>
 scored highest in a number of categories. Elias suggests that having 
insider knowledge of the specifics of an evaluation can give a 
submission an unfair advantage.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see how this can 
happen, even unintentionally.&nbsp; A system that is built and tuned 
against a particular collection of music could be overfitting the 
collection.&nbsp; Now if you bring this overfitting system to a new 
collection, its performance will tend to drop since it is not tuned to 
for the new collection. The overfitting hurts your system.&nbsp; 
However, if you are testing, training and tuning against a test 
collection that happens to overlap the evaluation collection,&nbsp; then
 it is possible that overfitting can help your system in the final 
evaluation.&nbsp; So for example, if the IMIRSEL system happened to be 
built and tuned against the same collection that was used in the MIREX 
evaluations, this may give that system an advantage. Knowing how 
difficult it is in this day of copyright litigation to build up a 
sizable test collection, it is not hard to imagine the IMIRSEL team 
using the MIREX evaluation collection to tune their system.<br><br>Now, I
 have worked closely with just about all of the members of the IMIRSEL 
team, and I know that they are an extremely talented set of individuals 
and are quite capable of creating a winning system.&nbsp; I also know 
that these folks are diligent, methodical and careful in how they design
 the MIREX evaluation to ensure the utmost in fairness.&nbsp; I have 
little doubt that the MIREX results accurately reflect the 
state-of-the-art.&nbsp; However, not everyone has had the opportunity of
 working with the IMIRSEL team and so not everyone may share the same 
confidence in the MIREX results.&nbsp; To alleviate these concerns, I 
suggest that the IMIRSEL team detail the datasets used in training and 
tuning the IMIRSEL submission, highlighting any overlaps with the data 
used in the MIREX evaluation.&nbsp; Such a disclosure will help 
alleviate any of the concerns some folks may have about the fairness of 
MIREX.&nbsp; For MIREX to be a viable long term evaluation, MIR 
researchers have to have a high confidence that it is fair.<br></p>

A visit to <a href="http://musicmobs.com/">MusicMobs.com</a> today will 
bring you to the register.com's domain parking page.&nbsp; Does this 
signal the demise of another (and my favorite) playlisting site? Is this
 just an oversight by Toby? Or is this the first indication of a new 
chapter in MusicMobs?</p><p><b>Update:&nbsp; MusicMobs is back.&nbsp; Perhaps it was just a glitch with the DNS.&nbsp; Nothing to see here move along.</b> <br></p>
