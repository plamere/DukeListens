The rainbow room at Spotify - it's in the city, has natural light, nice

Here at Sun, we've been thinking a bit about our office space.  Much of 
it was designed in the midst of the dot com boom - where offices had 
doors, there was desk space for one workstation and barely  room for a 
single visitor.  Maybe this environment isn't really the best way to 
foster an interesting and productive collaboration among team members.<br>
<br>
I've seen lots of photos of interesting workspaces for the Web 2.0 
companies.  These companies are small, have shoestring budgets, are 
staffed mostly by young, energetic types.  I think some of the offices 
of these companies may be interesting models for what our team space can
 look like at Sun.<br>
<br>
So with that, I may be posting a few images of Music 2.0 companies that 
seem to have some interesting office space.  And if you think your 
office is particularly interesting, toss a photo or two on Flickr and 
send me the link.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>A month ago, it was a pretty miserable time for Music 2.0.&nbsp; 
The Copyright Royalty Board had decided to raise fees on internet radio,
 threatening to put all of our favorite online music providers from 
Radio Paradise to Pandora out of business.&nbsp; But Online music 
received a stay of execution unto July 15th, while the RIAA tried to 
figure out the best way to decapitate the future of music.&nbsp; So the 
month of May started out pretty bleak for digital music - but since then
 all sorts of really good things have happened:</p><ul><li>Amazon 
announced that they were going to (for real this time) open a digital 
music store to compete with iTunes (remember, competition is good, split
 infinitives are bad)</li><li>Bills have been introduced to Congress to 
nullify the CRB decision (Tim Westergren of Pandora has been leading the
 fight, Thanks Tim)<br></li><li>Apple started selling DRM free tracks on
 iTunes (lets ignore the fact that Apple is embedding your email address
 in the 'DRM-Free' tracks for now.)</li><li>Pandora announced its new Pandora on-the-go products - moving internet radio onto portable devices and into the living room</li><li>MusicBranz started running there database on a Sun server. W00t!<br></li><li>Slacker received VC funding of $40 million (!)</li><li>CBS Buys Last.FM for $280 Million!!!!!!! (one '!' is worth $40 million nowadays)<br></li><li>All the cool Music 2.0 people have a party on Facebook<br></li><li>Net, Blogs and Rock and Roll gets a <a href="http://www.netblogsrocknroll.com/2007/06/book_cover.html">cover.</a><br></li><li>A million Facebookers start using the iLike plug-in, MOG has trouble keeping up with all of their new Facebook members</li><li>The Apple iPhone gets a release date<br></li><li>Pandora, Last.FM and Slacker get good mentions in the<a href="https://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1627008,00.html"> main stream press</a>.&nbsp; <br></li></ul><p>That's
 a whole lotta good stuff happening.&nbsp; I think we really are at some
 magic tipping point here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon it will be a normal thing 
for casual music listeners to use a music recommender-driven internet

				<p>As you all know by now, the audioscrobbler is a music player 
plugin from Last.FM that keeps track of what you play.&nbsp; When you 
play a track, the scrobbler scrobbles the play data back to last.fm 
where it is added to their massive taste database.&nbsp; The word 
'scrobble' really is a great word.&nbsp; It is fun to say, and in some 
odd way seems to be descriptive of my taste data being stuffed into a 
database. &nbsp; I've wondered if the word was a made up concoction of 
RJ (the guy at Last.FM who wrote the first scrobbler) or if the word was
 an English-ism that every UK resident uses every day ("Children, help 
me scrobble the blood pudding into the wardrobe"). &nbsp; I asked RJ 
about this - he says that he has always thought that the word was a made
 up word without any previous meaning.</p><p>Funny thing is, I encountered the word in the wild and not in the context of Music 2.0. &nbsp; I was reading the book called "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Neverwhere-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0380789019">Neverwhere</a>"
 by Neil Gaiman.&nbsp; In this book there is a passage of dialog between
 two characters (Vandemar and Coup) where
they talked about 'scrobbling' a girl&nbsp; (which likely meant that 
they&nbsp;
would do something nasty to her). This book was published before the 
birth of the Audioscrobbler, so I asked RJ about it. He said he never 
read it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also asked Neil Gaiman where he got the word 
from, but he has yet to reply.&nbsp; And so in the end we have a new 
word to add to the dictionary with perhaps at least two 
meanings.&nbsp;&nbsp; (I'm scrobbling some weezer right now).<br></p>

				<p>The blogosphere has been filled with posts lately about Facebook, especially with their new <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/25/facebook-users-really-like-music-ilike-is-most-popular-application/"></a><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook Platform</a>. At TechCrunch<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/25/facebook-users-really-like-music-ilike-is-most-popular-application/">, &nbsp; Mike Arrington posted </a>about
 how iLike has become the most popular Facebook app, with 10,000 users 
in just the first 10 hours of service.&nbsp; Last.fm joined the party 
late, but is gaining steam. &nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, I've been 
hearing from my kids (3 teenagers + 1 tweenager) that Facebook was the 
cool place to be now, "MySpace is so old and tired".&nbsp; My son who 
leaves soon for his first year in college has already made lots of 
college friends through a facebook group for freshman entering SUNY 
Plattsburgh.&nbsp; </p><p>So it seemed,&nbsp; I should learn more about 
Facebook. I signed up and explored a bit.&nbsp; Almost instantly I got 
'friend request' from Toby of <a href="http://musicmobs.com/">MusicMobs</a> - he was starting up a Music 2.0 Facebook group along with Jason (<a href="https://globallistic.blogspot.com/2007/06/music-20-group-now-on-facebook.html">MuSick in the Head</a>).&nbsp;
 I joined the group and have been really amazed at how quickly the group
 has grown. A testament to all things viral.&nbsp; In the past week, the
 Music 2.0 group has grown to over 30 members including principals and 
technical staff from companies like last.fm, iLike, Pandora, Goombah, 
MusicMobs,&nbsp; Grabb.it, GarageBand.&nbsp; It is pretty neat to see 
all these people in one space - it is interesting for&nbsp; instance to 
see that Tom Conrad, CTO of Pandora likes 'The Office' and has an active
 <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/tconrad/">Last.FM music profile.</a></p><p>I'm
 not exactly sure where this group is going or what will happen with it,
 but there's certainly a potential that I've never seen before, with 
everyone (potentially) from the music 2.0 space in the same 
'room'.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are doing things in the Music 2.0 space, feel
 free to join. Send me an email or leave a comment and I'll send you an 
invite. <br>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>In the video <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/online/video/conference/2007/mccready">Music Intelligence: 2012</a>, Malcolm Gladwell (Tipping Point, Blink), interviews Mike McCready, CEO of Platinum Blue.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.platinumblueinc.com/">Platinum Blue</a>
 is a company that has a "hit predictor" as well as a hybrid music 
recommender (using social and 'mathematical similarity'). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>I
 must admit that I've always been quite skeptical about hit predictors, 
and after watching this video I am even more skeptical.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Here's an example that set my bullsh*t detector off.</p><p>First we see a visualization of a music space:</p><p><img src="support_files/pb1.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Then,
 Mike shows us the same music space with all of the non-hits 
removed,&nbsp; this leaves a plot that shows just the hit songs:</p><p><img src="support_files/pb2.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">&nbsp;</p><p>It
 is rather amazing isn't it how well the hits cluster -&nbsp; and the 
clusters have such nice sharp boundaries too.&nbsp; It's almost too good
 to be true - no wait, it *is* too good to be true.<br><br>Platinum Blue
 claims that their hit predictor is 80% to 85% accurate.&nbsp; That's 
nothing, I can build a hit predictor that is 99.9% accurate.&nbsp; No 
matter what song you give my hit predictor it says "not a hit".&nbsp; If
 you run the 500,000 songs released last year through my hit predictor, 
it will only get about 500 of them wrong (the ones that actually became 
hits).<br></p><p>Listening to this interview makes my skin crawl - I 
just don't buy it, and I'm rather disappointed with Malcom Gladwell just
 accepting this without showing any skepticism.<br></p>
