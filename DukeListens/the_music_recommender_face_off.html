			<h2>The Music Recommender Face-Off - Part 1</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>There are lots of music recommenders out there, each one  vying for<br>our attention, trying to connect us to our next favorite band.  But not all<br>recommenders are created equal. Some have the insights and good taste of a<br>Bill Goldsmith or a John Peel, while others seem to have as much insight<br>about what I might like as an iPod on shuffle play. But which<br>recommenders are the best, and which are the worst? And how do these music<br>recommendations compare to what a professional would generate? Can machines<br>compete with humans in what is clearly a question of taste?  A few months<br>ago, I decided to try to answer these questions - to find out what is the<br>best music recommender, and to find out if machines can compete with humans<br>when it comes to recommending music.  Over the next few days, I shall be<br>blogging what I've discovered.<br><br><b>The tough question</b><br><br>The hardest question to answer is 'How to evaluate a recommendation?'.<br>A typical recommendaton starts with a seed artist, so for instance<br>a recommendation may be of the form "If you like The Beatles you may<br>like.. " followed by a list of recommended artists.  Now, when I look a<br>music recommendation based on an artist that I really know, I can get<br>a feel for the quality of recommendation.  In the list of recommended<br>artists, I expect to see some artists that I already am familiar with -<br>probably bands that I like.  Even though these recommendations may<br>be obvious, they help me gain some trust in the recommender. If I<br>ask for a recommendation based on my affinity for Miles Davis and<br>a recommender suggests John Coltrane, I get a warm feeling that the<br>recommender is on the right track.  It is a relevant (albeit somewhat<br>obvious) recommendation. I also expect to see some artists that I've<br>heard of but am not too familiar with, and I also expect to see some<br>artists that I've never heard of.  So for me a good recommendation<br>contains a mix of the familiar (to help me gain trust), and the novel<br>(to help me find new music).  Now of course, if the recommended artists<br>are off track ('if you like Miles Davis you might like Paris Hilton'),<br>no amount of familiarity or novelty is going to turn the recommendation<br>into a good recommendation.  The recommendations need to be relevant.<br>To summarize, a good recommendation has three aspects:<br></p><ul><li>   <b>familiarity</b> - to help us gain trust in the recommender</li><li><b>novelty</b> - without new music, the recommendation is pointless</li><li><b>relevance</b> - the recommended music has to match my taste<br></li></ul><p>Lets look at a couple of recommendation as examples.  Here's a set of<br>similar artist recommendations for The Beatles from last.fm.  According to<br>last.fm, if you like the Beatles you might like:<br></p><ul><li>    The Rolling Stones</li><li>    The Who</li><li>    John Lennon</li><li>    Led Zeppelin</li><li>    Queen</li><li>    Beach Boys</li><li>    Doors</li><li>    David Bowie</li><li>    Kinks<br></li></ul><p>Well, last.fm certainly gets the 'familiar' and the 'relevant', but<br>there's nothing novel here. Any fan of the Beatles has no doubt heard of<br>all of these bands, no great discoveries will be found in this selection.<br><br>Compare those to this set from Dominique, a professional music critic.<br>According to Dominque, if you like the Beatles you might like:<br></p><ul><li>    Paul McCartney/Wings</li><li>    John Lennon</li><li>    Harry Nilsson</li><li>    Queen</li><li>    George Harrison</li><li>    ELO</li><li>    Raspberries</li><li>    Badfinger</li><li>    XTC</li><li>    The Millennium<br></li></ul><p>This list has the familiar and relevant McCartney, Lennon, Harrison<br>and Queen as well as some artists that a typical Beatles fan may not<br>have heard of: The Raspberries and Millennium.  Dominique seems to have<br>restricted his recommendations to bands from the late sixties and early<br>seventies. Not an unreasonable choice, but it does perhaps reduce  the<br>novelty aspect of the recommendations.<br><br>Compare those to this set from Chris, another professional music critic.<br>According to Chris, if you like the Beatles you might like:<br></p><ul><li>    Chuck Berry</li><li>    Harry Nilsson</li><li>    XTC</li><li>    Marshall Crenshaw</li><li>    Super Furry Animals</li><li>    Badfinger</li><li>    The Raspberries</li><li>    The Flaming Lips</li><li>    Jason Faulkner</li><li>    Michael Penn<br></li></ul><p>So there's the familiar with Chuck Berry and Harry Nilsson, but I have to<br>pause and think for a bit about relevance - there's no Rolling Stones or<br>The Who to give me a warm fuzzy feeling, Chris gets to the novel artists<br>right away - high on novelty scale but not high on the familiarity scale<br>(at least for me).<br><br>And finally here's a set of similar artist from the All Music Guide.<br>According to All Music, if you like the Beatles you might like:<br></p><ul><li>    Hollies</li><li>    Searchers</li><li>    Peter and Gordon</li><li>    Monkees</li><li>    Gerry and the Pacemakers</li><li>    Bee Gees</li><li>    Zombies</li><li>    Dave Clark Five</li><li>    Remains</li><li>    Sorrows<br></li></ul><p>This list seems fairly balanced, there's the familiar (Monkees, Bee Gees,<br>Dave Clark Five, and the Hollies), they've avoided the cliches (no Rolling<br>Stones, Queen or the Who) and have some bands that I'm not too familar<br>with including a band called 'The Sorrows' who are described as "one of<br>the most overlooked bands of the British Invasion" which certainly looks<br>like something that'd be fun to listen to if I like the Beatles.<br><br>With these four examples, I've tried to show the three elements<br>that I look for in a good music recommendation: familiarity, relevance<br>and novelty. The difficulty is, of course, that no two people will agree<br>exactly on what is familiar, relevant or novel.  What I find novel, may be<br>familiar to a professional music critic, while a musician may find musical<br>relevance when I don't. The difficult job for a recommender, whether<br>it is human or a machine is to find the proper level of famililarity,<br>novelty and relevance for each person.<br><br>Finally, if we really want to evaluate a number of recommender systems,<br>to compare the quality of recommendations, we have to figure out a good<br>way to turn the very subjective measures that we've looked at here into<br>a set of objective measures that we can use to score recommendations.<br>Part 2 will look at some of the objective ways we will use to evaluate the<br>various music recommenders.<br><br></p>

<p>I have to wonder about the wisdom of using the Beatles as the 
canonical example for the sanity checks. They present the same sort of 
problem as Miles Davis in that over the course of their career, they 
made definitive statements in so many sub-genres that it's hard to say 
what is a *bad* recommendation. </p>

<p>@adam: fair enough criticism - I chose the Beatles for this example 
since everyone knows the Beatles - and common recommendations given for 
the Beatles such as the Rolling Stones or the Who are good examples of 
recommendations that fall into the 'good but not useful' category.  </p>

<p>Hey Paul,<br>
Thanks for throwing AMG into the mix.</p>


<p>I would like to propose a new term to replace "Novelty" in our 
general lexicon. When I hear the term "Novelty" in regards to music, I 
automatically think of Spike Jones, Alvin &amp; the Chipmunks and Weird 
Al.  </p>


<p>Is there another term that has the same meaning that doesn't already 
have a music-related connotation?  Freshness?  Newness? Unfamiliarity? 
Discovery? Introduciness???</p>

<p>Thanks Paul, it's a very interesting split of the aspects that should
 make a good recommendation list, or at least, a blind list (no 
explanation given to justify any of the choices). However I see two 
objections to this split.</p>


<p>First, each of the aspects must be weighted toward the use of the 
recommendation. If the sole use is uninterested recommendations of 
artists that you would like given you like seed A, it's a good 
separation, but there are more usages to "recommendations" than the list
 themselves, for human consumers... </p>


<p>How you define "relevance", especially, can affect the other two 
aspects. Some users might want the obvious results, because they don't 
want the list for their own discovery, but for a broader, more 
conservative goal, where others could only want to discover new things 
and have no interest in the common ground.</p>


<p>You also use "familiarity" to establish a trust in the "system", but 
these "no new information" recommendations are wasted slots once a 
confidence in the system is established.</p>


<p>I think the three aspects you've found are very good, but balance between them is essential.</p>


<p>Also, I know the inevitability of metrics, but creating one is almost
 an invitation to game it, SEO-style. How about an automated system that
 would game the three aspects you describe? 4-5 common recommendations 
(familiarity), 2-3 obscure/original choices (novelty), and some 
in-between, filtered by what you already know/listen to (personal 
relevance). Sounds a bit cynical, like the top 5 lists of High Fidelity,
 but perhaps, in the end, not totally bad...</p>


<p>Also, I think "personal relevance" would be a better expression than 
"relevance" alone, since this word could be used to qualify the whole 
quality of the recommendation.</p>

<p>If you are going to use last.fm as a music recommendation, what about using pandora.com as well?</p>


<p>The challenge with using the Beattles as a test group, is that their 
style of music varies.  If you like one song, it may match these bands, 
but another song, may be more like these bands over here.</p>
