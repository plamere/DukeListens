<br><br><img style="float: right;"  ="" src="support_files/celestialjukebox.jpg">One
 of the key enabling technologies for the ecosystem that will ultimately
 become the celestial jukebox is a universally used, free, Song ID 
system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Song ID system unambiguously assigns an an 
ID, (much like a UPC product code), to each unique audio 
recording.&nbsp; The ideal SongID will be able to distinguish between 
various performances and remixes of a song, while still recognizing that
 different encodings and equalizations of a song are still the same 
song.&nbsp;&nbsp; A universally used songID will allow&nbsp; various 
music tools and services to work together.&nbsp; People will be able to 
easily share playlists, recommenders will be able to refer listeners to 
tracks in any music service provider collection.&nbsp; It will be easy 
to find the metadata (album art, reviews, bibliographic info, lyrics) 
for a song.<br><br>There's no shortage of commercial songID 
system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that they all cost money, and they 
tie you to a particular vendor's silo (songID, metadata, 
recommender).&nbsp;&nbsp; No one vendor's songID has enough traction to 
become the universal songID.&nbsp; <br><br><img src="./support_files/MusicDNSorg.png"><br>The one system that has the best shot at becoming the universal songID system is the <a href="http://musicdns.org/" target="_self">MusicDNS</a> system.&nbsp; The MusicDNS system was created by&nbsp; the folks at <a href="http://musicip.com/" target="_self">MusicIP.</a>&nbsp;
 With the MusicDNS system, you use their open-source fingerprinter to 
get a fingerprint of audio. This fingerprint is sent to MusicDNS that 
(much like the Internet DNS), will resolve the fingerprint into a songID
 <span style="font-style: italic;">(update - and some a bit of metadata including track and artist name) </span>that
 can then be used to retrieve metadata associated with the music from 
metadata sources such as&nbsp; MusicBrainz (a wikipedia-like source of 
music metadata).<br><img src="support_files/MetaBrainz_logo.png"><br><br>I
 like the MusicDNS system because they have open-sourced the client and 
have worked very closely with MusicBrainz to make sure that the system 
will be available no matter what happens to MusicIP.&nbsp; (Spend a few 
minutes talking to Robert Kaye, the founder of MusicBrainz, and you'll 
hear nothing but good things about MusicIP and MusicDNS).<br><br>The 
MusicDNS system has always been free to use for non-commercial use, but 
if you were a commerical entity you had to negotiate a deal, and it was 
hard to predict what the final costs would be.&nbsp; (They would charge 
based on the number of songID lookups).&nbsp; <br><br>MusicDNS has just <a href="http://musicdns.org/licensing.jsp" target="_self">restructured</a> how it charges for use.&nbsp; A non-commercial license still is free for 5 million lookups per month. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Update -&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">commercial</span> access of up to 5 million requests per month is also free)&nbsp;</span>
 But now with the restructuring a commercial license costs $250 per year
 for up to 100 million lookups per month!&nbsp; That is so incredibly 
cheap that it should be a no-brainer even for the smallest web 2.0&nbsp;
 music startup.&nbsp; In fact it is so cheap that I doubt if it even 
covers the costs of running the MusicDNS lookup servers.<br><br>MusicDNS is doing all of the right things. They are <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/03/new_fingerprint.html" target="_self">supporting MusicBrainz</a>,
 an excellent source for music metadata.&nbsp; They have opensourced the
 fingerprinting client. They have made the cost to use the system cheap 
enough so that anyone can use it . &nbsp; I really hope each and every 
one of those new music discovery companies (you all know who you are) 
will just start using this system.&nbsp; If we are all using this 
system, we can interoperate, we can trade playlists, we will all be 
steering our metadata updates to MusicBrainz, so our metadata will get 
better.&nbsp; The music ecosystem will be a better place.&nbsp; <br><br>

                Hi Paul -<br><br>

Thanks for the kind words!<br><br>

We are really excited about the new pricing we just rolled out (press 
release and such to come), and there is a new version of MusicDNS with 
additional metadata on the horizon...<br><br>

I'd love to hear from you if you have any questions or feedback.<br><br>

Thanks again!<br><br>

All the Best,<br>

As my colleague Adam said, we really appreciate the kind words.  <br>

Two small factual corrections for your readers.<br>  1) The 
under-5-million-hits isn't non-commercial pricing. That's _anybody_ 
pricing. (We know that $250 can be a hurdle for a developer or a 
shareware shop.) All you have to do is register.<br>
2) MusicDNS returns metadata along with IDs, which some of you might find useful.  We'll have more news on that front shortly.  <br>

Thanks for listening, Duke..<br>
