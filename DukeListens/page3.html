				This is pretty cool.  The MIREX team is hosting a new evaluation 
that will attempt to compare music tagging algorithms using the 'Tag a 
Tune' (a member of the games-with-a-purpose family of labeling games).  
The goal of this evaluation competition is to investigate a new method 
of evaluating music tagging algorithms, by using them as bots in 
Tagatune, and measuring the number of mistakes players make in guessing 
whether they are listening to the same or different songs (we will call 
this the Tagatune metric) when paired against different algorithm bots.

The details are here:  <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/2009/index.php/SpecialTagatuneEvaluation">SpecialTagatuneEvaluation</a>

  It will be pretty interesting if CBS gives this responsibility to 
Last.fm (which is owned by CBS).  This would turn the Web 2.0 world 
upside down. During its heyday, Yahoo was acquiring all the cool web 2.0
 properties, like Flickr, Delicious, Upcoming, Webjay, and FoxyTunes. It
 would be quite a turn of events if Yahoo music was taken over by

 Hey all - I need some help.  I'm giving a short talk this week to some 
young folk (ages 15 to 20) - one point I'd like to make is how music 
discovery is shifting away from traditional recommendation ('people who 
like X also like Y') and toward things like guitar hero and rock band.  
Since the audience is the squarely in the guitar hero demographic I 
thought I could make the point quite easily by playing a few 'guitar 
hero' greatest hits. In particular I'm looking for older songs by bands 
that teenagers would probably never have otherwise heard if not for 
guitar hero. 
<p>
 Even though I've played GH a bit, I'm not the right age to make the 
best call. So to be specific - what is the best example of guitar hero 
leading teens to music that they would never otherwise have listened to?

 40 years ago this month, the White Album was released by The Beatles.  
The White Album is perhaps my favorite from The Beatles - with classics 
like "while My Guitar gently weeps" and "helter skelter" - whimsical 
tracks such as "rocky raccoon" and "why don't we do it in the road" and 
the head scratchers like "revolution #9" and "wild honey pie".
<p>
There's an interesting look back at the White Album on the All Songs Considered podcast:  <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97391032">'The White Album' 40 years later</a>
 - with all sorts of interesting tidbits (Paul McCartney plays drums on 
'Back in the U.S.S.R' after Ringo leaves the studio in a huff), 
recordings of practice sessions and songs that didn't make the cut.  The
 podcast is worth a listen.

			<h3><a href="the_perceptron_astute_music_recommendations.html" title="permalink">The perceptron - astute music recommendations</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<a href="http://theperceptron.com/">The perceptron</a> is a music recommender built by London-based programmer <a href="http://blog.maryrosecook.com/">maryrosecook</a>.
 Instead of relying on the usual collaborative filtering methods used in
 most recommenders, the perceptron combines data from a number of 
sources such as music playlist sites, Mp3 blogs, Myspace, Wikipedia and 
real live humans to build the recommendations. 
<p>
<a href="http://theperceptron.com/"><img src="support_files/_percep.png" alt="percep.1.png" border="0" width="500"></a>
</p><p>
The interface is very simple - just type in the name of an artist that 
you like and the perceptron will give you a list of artists to try out -
 you can listen to music by the artist, read their Wikipedia bio, 
purchase tracks by the artist, add the artist to a playlist, etc.  If 
you sign up and login to the perceptron, it tracks your activity and 
starts to adapt the recommendations based upon what you pay attention 
to.  One thing I really like is how the perceptron tells you where the 
source of a recommendation comes from, like so:
<img src="support_files/_percep-reason.png" alt="percep-reason.png" border="0"> 
</p><p>
This explanation is helpful in giving me a better understanding of why a particular recommendation was made.
</p><p>
maryrosecook <a href="http://blog.maryrosecook.com/post/6764040/Creating-a-music-recommendation-engine">explains the algorithm</a>
 she uses in her blog.  Included in her explanation is a table of 
weights that she's derived from user activity for the various sources of
 artist similarity data:
</p><p>
</p><table>
<tbody><tr><td>Epitonic similar artists </td><td>	0.439
</td></tr><tr><td>Tiny Mix Tapes similar artists </td><td>	0.316
</td></tr><tr><td>Myspace top friends </td><td>	0.128
</td></tr><tr><td>Mixtapes </td><td>	0.075
</td></tr><tr><td>Record labels </td><td>	0.020
</td></tr><tr><td>Epitonic other artists </td><td>	0.016
</td></tr><tr><td>MP3 blogs </td><td>	0.003
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>
No surprise that Epitonic similar artists have the highest weight, and 
is responsible for a good portion of the recommendations.  I am a bit 
surprised that the MP3 blogs have such a low impact on the 
recommendations. maryrosecook does indicate that these weights were 
derived after only a rather small amount of usage (200 user ratings) so 
they may change quite a bit as the system is used more.
</p><p>
The recommendations from the perceptron are not always great.  Sometimes
 you can see evidence of some recommendation spam (if I like the Beatles
 will I really like the Bloody Beetroots?). On the other hand, the 
recommendations from the perceptron are highly novel and diverse  - very
 different from what you'd see at Last.fm, iTunes or Amazon.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_percep-deerhoof.png" alt="percep-deerhoof.png" border="0">
</p><p>
In addition to the occasional bum recommendation, there are a few kinks -
 wikipedia bios go astray (I'm reading about cloud formations instead of
 the bio for the band 'Cirrus' right now). Wikipedia markup sometimes 
sneaks through the filters.  The music collection is skewed toward the 
Myspace crowd, so us old folk who are looking for recommendations based 
upon Rick Wakeman or The Nice are up the creek without a recommendation.
 But despite these issues, I like the perceptron.  It has an indie feel -
 something that was done more as a labor of love to help people find 
music rather than just another way to make money selling music.  The 
recommendations are offbeat - but for me that means finding out about a 
whole lot of bands that I've never heard of.  I hope maryrosecook keeps 
at this project - (well, at least until she gets hired by Last.fm). The 
perceptron is a great way to find new music. (Oh, and her <a href="http://blog.maryrosecook.com/">blog</a> is a pretty fun read too).

				Clive Thompson has an excellent piece today in the New York Times Magazine about recommendation:  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23Netflix-t.html?hp=&amp;pagewanted=all">If you liked this, You're sure to love that</a>. The article gives a good overview of the <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">Netflix prize</a>
 and some of the problems that the competitors face in dealing with 
trying to predict whether  you would give "Michael Clayton"  2.2 stars 
or 2.3 stars. As Steve Krause <a href="http://www.stevekrause.org/steve_krause_blog/2008/11/nyt-netflix-article.html">points out</a>,
 Clive Thompson even tries to explain how singular value decomposition 
works - not something you see everyday in a newspaper article.
<p>
Clive does seem to to fall into a a common trap that assumes that 
computers must be seeing nuances and connections that humans can't:
</p><ul>
Possibly the algorithms are finding connections so deep and subconscious
 that customers themselves wouldn‚Äôt even recognize them. At one point, 
Chabbert showed me a list of movies that his algorithm had discovered 
share some ineffable similarity; it includes a historical movie, ‚ÄúJoan 
of Arc,‚Äù a wrestling video, ‚ÄúW.W.E.: SummerSlam 2004,‚Äù the comedy ‚ÄúIt 
Had to Be You‚Äù and a version of Charles Dickens‚Äôs ‚ÄúBleak House.‚Äù For the
 life of me, I can‚Äôt figure out what possible connection they have, but 
Chabbert assures me that this singular value decomposition scored 4 
percent higher than Cinematch ‚Äî so it must be doing something right. As 
Volinsky surmised, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre able to tease out all of these things that 
we would never, ever think of ourselves.‚Äù The machine may be 
understanding something about us that we do not understand ourselves.
</ul>
Or they may just be overfitting the data.
<p>
I was hoping to see Clive talk about the problems with the Netflix prize
 - how it over emphasizes the importance of relevance in recommendation 
at the expense of novelty and transparency.  The teams involved in the 
Netflix prize spend all of their time trying to predict how many stars 
each of the many thousands of Netflix customers would apply to movies.  
This skews the recommendations away from novel and <a href="http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/11/14/measuring-the-diversity-of-recommended-lists-at-last/">diverse</a> recommendations.  
</p><p>
Similarly, the Netflix prize pays no attention to helping people understand why something is being recommended. There are some <a href="https://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297275">good</a>
 papers that show that recommenders that can explain why something is 
being recommended can improve a users trust in the recommender and its 
recommendations. 
</p><p> The short and accessible paper: <a href="http://www.grouplens.org/node/126">Being accurate is not enough: how accuracy metrics have hurt recommender systems</a> provides an excellent counterpoint to the approach taken by the Netflix prize.  Some highlights from this paper:
</p><ul>
<li>  Item-Item similarity can bury the user in a 'similarity hole' of like items.
</li><li> Recommendations with higher diversity are preferred by users 
even when the lists perform worse on Netflix-prize style accuracy 
measures.
</li></ul>
The New York Times article describes the 'Napoleon Dynamite' problem - 
this is a film that people either love (five stars) or hate (1 star) and
 it is really hard to predict.  One researcher says that this single 
movie, of the 100,000 movies in the Netflix collection, accounts for 15%
 of the error in their recommender.  I suggest that a better way to deal
 with the Napoleon Dynamite problem is incorporate this uncertainty into
 the recommendation directly.  A recommendation such as "Napoleon 
Dynamite is a quirky film that appeals to a certain sense of humor - you
 may love this movie, or you may hate this movie - but whichever, it 
will certainly be something you will remember." - will be much more 
informative than a recommendation of "3 stars".
<p>
When people learn that I work with recommender systems, they will often 
ask me if I am working on the Netflix prize - I tell them no, I am not -
 because of two reasons - first, there are some people who are way 
smarter than me who are already working on this problem - and they will 
certainly get better results than I would ever be able to, and second, 
and perhaps more importantly, - I don't think it is a very relevant 
problem to solve - there are other aspects of recommendation: novelty, 
diversity, transparency steerability, coverage, and trust that are as 
important - and a good recommender can't just optimize one aspect, it 
has to look at all of these aspects.

			<h3><a href="the_yes_developer_api.html" title="permalink">The YES Developer API</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<a href="https://api.yes.com/"><img src="support_files/_77C08F7C-9DAB-43F5-B72A-CFA31C6155DA.jpg" alt="77C08F7C-9DAB-43F5-B72A-CFA31C6155DA.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" border="0" height="150" width="197"></a><a href="https://www.yes.com/#YES_Lobby">Yes.com</a>
 is an aggregator of information about terrestrial radio.  They track 
the song playing activity of many thousands of radio stations.  Now they
 are making all of this wonderful data available via a<a href="https://api.yes.com/"> web API</a>.  
<p>
You can do all sorts of things with the API - you can search for 
stations (by call letter, by location, by style of music etc.), find out
 what a particular station is playing, find out which artists or tracks 
are popular etc.
</p><p>
 For instance, to find the stations near me I can just search using my zipcode:
</p><p>
<a href="https://api.yes.com/1/stations?loc=03064">http://api.yes.com/1/stations?loc=03064</a>
</p><p>
This yields a bunch of json (JavaScript Object Notation) that describes the local radio stations.
</p><p>
The API lets you get all sorts of interesting data, including:
</p><ul>
 <li> The log of all songs played on any station in the last week
  </li><li> The top songs on any station (based on plays or user voting)
  </li><li> Overall popularity of a song or artist
  </li><li> Related songs (based upon playlist co-occurrence)
</li></ul>
<p>
Some more examples:
</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="https://api.yes.com/1/chart?name=WBCN">Top tracks on local radio station WBCN</a>
   </li><li> <a href="https://api.yes.com/1/log?name=WBCN&amp;ago=1">All the songs played yesterday on WBCN</a>.
   </li><li> <a href="https://api.yes.com/1/media?q=stairway+to+heaven">Info about 'stairway to heaven'.</a>
   </li><li> <a href="https://api.yes.com/1/related?mid=7016218">Songs 'related' to 'stairway to heaven'</a> (there's more Eddie Money on this list than I would have expected).
</li></ul>
This is a gold mine of data about popular music.  Folks interested in <a href="http://www.schnitzer.at/dominik/moc/">automatic</a> <a href="https://stuffalsothings.blogspot.com/2008/09/introductory-thoughts-on-playlist.html">generation</a> of <a href="http://www2.iiia.csic.es/%7Eclaudio/">playlists</a>
 can mine song sequences from professionally curated playlists.  Music 
marketeers can learn what music is popular in various geographic 
locations.  Music recommenders can mine data about what songs are being 
played together on the radio stations.  Given that terrestrial radio is 
still the way that most people discover new music, this data is very 
useful in helping us understand what people are listening to.
<p>
The API is full featured, is very fast and seems quite solid.  My 
biggest gripe is that it serves up JSON and not XML (which is what just 
about every other music api serves), so  it means incorporating another 
parser in my code.  The folks at YES are thinking about making an XML 
version, so even this gripe may be short-lived.
</p><p>
The API terms of use are quite reasonable - if you use their data on a 
web site, you must link back to YES.com.  Commercial use is "available 
and often immediately granted by just ensuring proper linking." 
</p><p>
This API has lots of data that hasn't been easily available before - 
data that can be used to enable music discovery, playlist generation, 
trend spotting.  Well done to the Yes.com developers for providing such a
 clean and easy to use API - and well done to the Yes.com business folk 
who realize the value in making this data available.  (And, by the way, 
the <a href="https://www.yes.com/#YES_Lobby">Yes.com</a> site itself is pretty cool).
