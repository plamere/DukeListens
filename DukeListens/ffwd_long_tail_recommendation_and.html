			<h2>ffwd - Long tail recommendation and discovery for video</h2>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://www.ffwd.com/"><img src="support_files/orange_left.gif" style="margin: 10px; float: left;" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>There's
 an ever growing number of videos on the web.&nbsp; YouTube seems to 
have an endless supply of everything from professional documentaries to 
phonecam captures of the latest campus tasing.&nbsp; Despite this video 
glut, finding interesting videos is not so easy.&nbsp; My current 
approach is to go to YouTube or Digg and just watch the most popular 
videos of the day.&nbsp; It's not too satisfying.&nbsp; A video of a 30 
second car crash&nbsp; has a much better chance of making these charts 
than a thoughtful, well-crafted film. Clearly tools for helping us 
explore this long tail of video will be increasingly important.</p><p>ffwd
 is&nbsp; new service (still in private beta), that is hoping to help 
you find discover web video. &nbsp; I've taken it for a quick 
spin.&nbsp; They have a pretty nifty enrollment process - where you 
click on shows that you like so they can get an idea of your 
taste.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you've selected your shows they assign you a 
video personality based upon your selections (I'm a 'comedy writer', 
apparently I like comedies).&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you are enrolled you can 
start to discover videos. </p><p>The video discovery is labeled as 
'alpha' and they aren't kidding. The recommendations don't seem to be 
related to what I like at all.&nbsp; They offered reality shows (The 
Apprentice, Extreme Makeover Home Edition), weight loss success stories 
from San Antonio,&nbsp; a 'sexy webcam girl', nothing that I was 
interested in. The videos are coming from video sharing sites like iFilm
 and YouTube.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since they are in alpha, we can forgive them 
their recommendations, especially since they&nbsp; do seem to be looking
 for the right type of people to build their recommender.&nbsp; They 
have a <a href="http://www.ffwd.com/jobs">job posting</a> for an AI expert with skills like:</p><ul><li>computational linguistics</li><li>collaborative filtering</li><li>behavioral profiling</li><li>relationship mapping</li><li>semantic clustering</li><li>symbolic systems</li><li>Bayesian statistics</li><li>feedback analysis</li><li>personalized search <br></li></ul><p>&nbsp;That's
 a pretty good sign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think ffwd is targeting a real 
void - video discovery on the web - it will be interesting to see if 
they can do better than what we see now on Digg or YouTube.&nbsp; Oh 
yeah, The <a href="http://blog.ffwd.com/">ffwd blog </a>is pretty interesting too.</p>

<p>Sounds really interesting. MovieLens, LibraryThing, etc. have been 
around for a while, but even though in a way they are 'Web 3.0' services
 (peer recommendations), in another way they are still stuck in the 
past, when it comes to integration: sure, you get access to the IMDb or 
Amazon page for the item, but that's the extent of integration offered.</p>


<p>ffwd promises that -- the video is available in the same interface, 
so you can quickly act on a recommendation. There's still a problem, in 
that the service still relies on network effect in what is nearly a 
zero-sum game: more users here means less users for other peer 
recommendation services. Some people would be using multiple services, 
which means their data likely won't be up to date in all, which means 
the services will offer suboptimal recommendations (so it's bad for all 
concerned).</p>


<p>Take the new Data Portability initiative into account, though, and a 
market in recommendation services could soon spring up. Use various 
services, and give them authorization to pull your rating data from each
 other. The user gets to experiment with which site has the algorithms 
and user base to provide good ratings in which situations, and the 
services get to compete on how good they do their jobs, not merely how 
well they can gobble up and lock their market down (think Wintel).</p>
