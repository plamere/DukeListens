				<p><a href="http://ismir2007.ismir.net/">ISMIR</a>, the annual Music
 Information Retrieval conference is just a week away.&nbsp; I'm really 
looking forward to it.&nbsp; It is always a great learning experience, a
 super opportunity to meet lots of energetic, and very smart people that
 are passionate about music.&nbsp; This year I'll be busy too. I'm 
presenting with Oscar a&nbsp; <a href="http://ismir2007.ismir.net/tutorials.html#tut2">music recommendation tutorial</a>,
 two poster sessions (Thierry is doing all the hard work on one of 
them), and I am a chair for the session on recommendation.&nbsp; This 
will be only my second time acting as a session chair.&nbsp; At last 
year's ISMIR I learned about what my duties are as a session 
chair.&nbsp; There are really just two things: make sure that the 
speakers end on time, and make sure that during the Q&amp;A after a talk
 that if no one else asks a question that you ask one. Apparently, every
 speaker needs at least one question to feel fulfilled as a 
speaker.&nbsp; Easy enough, end on time and ask a question if needed.<br><br>It
 was in my role as session chair that I had my worst ISMIR moment.&nbsp;
 I was doing fine making sure that the speakers ended on time (even when
 we had to swap speakers around when one chap couldn't get his slides to
 appear on the projector).&nbsp; However there was one speaker who gave a
 talk about a topic that I just didn't understand. I didn't grasp the 
goal of the research,&nbsp; the methods, the conclusions or the 
applicability of the research.&nbsp; All the way through the talk I was 
wracking my brains trying to eek out an appropriate, salient question 
about the research. A question that wouldn't mark me as the idiot that I
 clearly was. By the end of the talk I was regretting my decision to 
accept the position as session chair.&nbsp; I could only pray that 
someone else would ask the required question and save me from 
humiliating myself and insulting the speaker.&nbsp; The speaker 
concluded the talk,&nbsp; I stood up and thanked the speaker, offered a 
silent prayer to the God of Curiosity and then asked the assembled for 
questions. Silence.&nbsp; Long Silence. Really long silence. My worst 
nightmare. I was going to ask a question, but by this point I couldn't 
even remember what the talk was about. It was going to be a bad 
question, something like "Why do you find this topic interesting?" or 
"Isn't Victoria nice?".&nbsp; Just microseconds before I uttered my 
feeble query, a hand went up,&nbsp; I was saved. Someone asked a 
question.&nbsp; I don't remember the question, I just remember the 
relief. My job as session chair was complete, every speaker had their 
question.</p><p>&nbsp;This year, I think I'll be a bit more comfortable 
as a session chair.&nbsp; I know the topic of the session quite well 
(recommendation), and I know the speakers too, but still, please don't 
be offended if I ask you "why do you find this topic interesting?"<br></p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>The Amazon music store is soon to be unveiled - and soon 
afterwards we will all know whether it is going to be a serious 
competitor to iTunes.&nbsp; Here's what Amazon needs to do&nbsp; to 
compete:</p><ul><li><b>Work seamlessly with the iPod&nbsp;</b> - If I, 
(or more importantly, a non-digital-music guru), can't get the music 
from the Amazon store onto their nano or their shuffle, then the store 
is a non-starter.</li><li><b>Broad and Deep Catalog - </b>The Amazon bookstore is a poster child for the long tail - they better do the same for music.</li><li><b>DRM-Free</b> - Rumor is that Amazon is doing the right thing here ... no DRM for their tracks.</li><li><b>Discovery and Recommendation - </b>Amazon
 is well known for its recommendation and personalization 
technologies.&nbsp; If they can make it as easy to find new music as 
they make it finding new books then Jeff may give Steve a run for his 
money.</li></ul>That's what they need to do. Here's<a href="the_top_five_things_that.html"> what I hope they will do too</a>.<br><p>&nbsp;</p>

 The publishers did a nice job - it is a very pretty book (with a nice

week.&nbsp; As I said to David (which found it's way onto the cover of 
the book as a blurb), this book is a super read that should be on the

the way I think about music listeners.

				<p>I've had an excellent response so far to the music recommendation
 survey that I'm conducting.&nbsp; I've received nearly 200 responses 
and have collected nearly 10,000 datapoints.&nbsp; This data will be 
extremely useful for evaluating music recommenders.&nbsp; There's all 
sorts of interesting data in the survey. For instance, people think that
 if you like The Beatles, you'll probably prefer Mozart over Aerosmith. 
That's probably because Aerosmith were the 'Future Villain Band' in that
 great film of 1978 - "Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts club band" - where 
they played their evil cover of 'Come Together'.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If you haven't already, please take:&nbsp;<a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/WebSurvey/survey.html"> The Music Recommendation Survey</a><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

resolve any track to a unique ID based upon the audio content of the 
track.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.last.fm/2007/09/10/fingerprinting-update?commented=1#c001187"> RJ, one of the founders of last.fm, indicates</a>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><i>In the comments section, <a href="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/if_you_like_the_beatles#comments.html">Ian raises some questions</a>
 about the relevance of artist-level recommendations and why I'm 
interested in this type of evaluation.&nbsp; Instead of burying my 
answers in the comments, I'll respond right here:</i></p><p>I think 
there is room in the world for both artist-level recommendations and 
track-level recommendations.&nbsp; Clearly for sites like Pandora that 
are trying to give their users a traditional radio-like listening 
experience, quite a bit of attention should be paid to making good 
playlists, and this involves understanding music similarity at the track
 level, otherwise the listeners will get iPod whiplash from the Eleanor 
Rigby to Helter Skelter song transitions. There are many situations 
where track level recommendations are going to be best.<br><br>But I 
don't discount artist-level recommendations.&nbsp; These are important 
for someone who is looking for new music.&nbsp; Every month I head over 
to eMusic to try out a brand new artist - but I don't pick them 
randomly, nor do I pick the artist at the top of the charts, I'll use an
 artist level recommender to find an artist that I might like based on 
artists I already like.<br><br>For this study, since my goal was to 
compare (at least casually), various recommenders, I really had to use a
 lowest-common-denominator approach.&nbsp; Most commercial recommenders 
will give you artist-level recommendations, or 'similar-artist' 
lists.&nbsp; Only a very few give track level recommendations.&nbsp; I 
decided to start with the simplest of recommendation tasks: artist-level
 recommendations based upon a single artist seed.&nbsp; There are a 
dozen recommenders that support this type of recommendation, so it 
seemed to be the best task for a first comparison.&nbsp; This does, 
however, leave out a number of recommenders that work at the track level
 (Pandora and Zukool for instance).&nbsp; This doesn't mean that I think
 track-level recommendations are not important.<br><br>I am really 
interested in exploring the question "What makes a good 
recommendation?".&nbsp; When I look at the various recommendations 
offered for the seed artist 'The Beatles' I am really forced to think 
hard about that question.&nbsp; Is 'The Rolling Stones' a good answer to
 "If you like The Beatles you might like ..."? Surely anyone who has 
heard of the Beatles must also know about the Rolling Stones and has 
already made up their minds about them, one way or another, so it can't 
be a good recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, seeing "The 
Rolling Stones" on a list of Beatles-like recommendations, gives me some
 confidence that the recommender is giving reasonable 
recommendations.&nbsp; Questions of popularity, serendipity, 
familiarity, trust, and fashion all factor into people's sense of what 
makes a good recommendation.&nbsp; I'd like to understand this at a 
deeper level.</p><p>With that here's what I am doing in this study:<br></p><ol><li>Collecting
 artist-level recommendations from a number of commercial and academic 
machine-based recommender systems for 5 seed artists</li><li>Collecting artist-level recommendations from a number of professional music critics, for the same 5 seed artists</li><li>Comparing the machine-based systems to see how well they agree with each other</li><li>Comparing the humans to see how well they agree with each other</li><li>Comparing the machine-based recommendations to the human created recommendations</li><li>Collect data via a survey that ranks that quality of each recommended artist.</li><li>Score the various recommenders based upon the quality of recommendations as scored in the survey.<br></li></ol><p>There
 are all sorts of things that I am not measuring, mainly because it is 
hard to figure out how to measure it. Of particular importance are:<br></p><ol><li>Serendipity
 - it is unlikely that a survey taker, when encountering a recommended 
artist that they don't recognize in the survey  will actually go and 
listen to the artist and then rate the quality of the 
recommendation.&nbsp; No one is going to take the time to do that. But 
this is what we really want to measure - did we recommend something to 
you that was novel and interesting to you?</li><li>Trust - to me, a good
 recommendation list will contain some artists that I already know, and 
some that I don't. For this survey, you are not seeing the individual 
artist lists, so you can't make an assesment of how reliable an 
recommendation list is.</li></ol><p>The bottom line is that there are 
many, many factors that make a good recommendation, and it is not always
 easy to measure these things, but there are some things that we can do 
to start to understand which factors are most important.<br></p><p>I 
hope I answer at least some of your questions - and I appreciate input 
from many of the smart minds that read this blog on how to do this 
better.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

Well, I learned my lesson ... don't use 'mailto' to collect survey 
results.&nbsp; It is just not a reliable way to do it.&nbsp; I've 
recoded the survey to use a real servlet that logs the results where I 
can collect them at my leisure.&nbsp; This should work better now.&nbsp;
 So, I encourage you to<a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/WebSurvey/survey.html"> take the survey</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;Also,
 based on comments received, I'm including all of the seed artists in 
the survey instead of starting with just&nbsp; 'The Beatles'.<br>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>In a few weeks, I'll be presenting (along with Oscar Celma), a<a href="http://ismir2007.ismir.net/tutorials.html#tut2"> music recommendation tutorial</a> at <a href="http://ismir2007.ismir.net/index.html">ISMIR 2007</a>.&nbsp;
 As part of this tutorial, Oscar and I will be presenting various 
evaluations of commercial and academic music recommenders.&nbsp; There 
are lots of ways to evaluate recommender systems, but when you get right
 down to it, probably the best way is to ask people what they think 
about them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so... we are conducting a survey and we hope
 that <font color="#000000"><b>you</b></font> will participate.&nbsp; 
The survey is very simple:&nbsp; you are asked to rate the quality 
of&nbsp; recommendations that are of the form "If you like The Beatles 
you might like XXX".&nbsp; The&nbsp; survey will take less than 10 
minutes to complete. If you are interested, then </p><p align="center"><a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/WebSurvey/survey.html"><font size="5">Take the survey</font></a><br></p><p>The
 results of the survey will be used to rank various recommendations 
generated by commercial,&nbsp; and academic recommender systems, as well
 as recommendations generated by professional music 
critics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surveys for recommendations based on other 
seed artists will be coming soon.</p><p>We are hoping to get 100s of 
replies so feel free to tell others about the survey. I shall be posting
 results after the conference at the end of the month.</p><p><i>Update: Well, it turns out using the 'mailto:'</i>&nbsp; <i>on
 a form post is notoriously unreliable, so I spent a few hours this 
morning fixing it, so now things should work quite a bit better.</i><br></p>

 night everyone was out of the house except for Jennie and me. Jennie is
 a 12 year old, and is probably the most avid music listener of my 4 
children.&nbsp; We have a computer connected to the stereo so I decided I
 would show her how last.fm worked.&nbsp; We fired up 'high school 
musical' tag radio (if you have a pre-teen girl in your household, you 
probably know all about High School Musical),&nbsp; pointed our web 
browser at <a href="http://snappradio.com/">Snapp Radio</a> and had our 
own little high school musical party.&nbsp; Snapp Radio did a fine job 
of selecting good photos (there are lots of high school musical concert 
photos on Flickr) - However, Snapp Radio did get a bit torn between 
showing photos of Vanessa Hudgens (aka Gabriella) and Rodrigo y 
Gabriella - the acoustic-metal duo.&nbsp; All in all, it was a fun time,
 however, I now have a whole lot of tracks in my last.fm music listening
 history that I'd rather not have - Britney Spears, Ryan and Sharpay,, 
Troy, Get'cha Head in the Game. Hopefully this won't change what last.fm
 thinks of me too much.&nbsp; (Despite it's indie leanings, I am not the
 lone High School Musical listener at Last.fm.&nbsp; This week, 4 of the
 top 5 on the Artist Hype List at last.fm are High School Musical 
related).</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
