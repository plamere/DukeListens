				At the <a href="http://echonest.com/lab/cast/article/10/poll">EchoNest blog,</a>
 they've posted 5 example mixes generated by&nbsp; their Auto DJ - the 
Auto DJ can automatically time-stretch or compress and align tracks to 
give a seemless playlist (anyone who's listened to shuffle play on an 
iPod knows how important that can be).&nbsp; Listen to the Beatles track
 - its pretty interesting to hear the different songs fade in and out - 
it almost sounds like a completely new Beatles song. It's pretty neat.

inside look at the techniques musicians use to put their signature on
the music they write and perform.
We do get
into a little music theory, but we've tried to make it interesting and
understandable for anyone who's even just a little curious about music.<br></i><br>The
 first podcast: The Basics of Vocal Harmony offered a set of 
descriptions along with short examples tutti harmony, unison singing, 
parallel and contrary motion and call and response . Greg and Kelly from
 the San Francisco band <a href="http://www.20minuteloop.com/news.html" target="_blank">20 Minute Loop</a>&nbsp;
 provide the vocals for these demonstrations.&nbsp; It is really quite 
an effective 9 minute lesson on vocal harmony. &nbsp;</p><p>The first 
podcast was fantastic, it was short, to the point, professionally 
recorded and crammed with information - more information in 9 minutes 
than most podcasts give you in 99 minutes.&nbsp; I look forward to the 
next one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen to the <a href="http://blog.pandora.com/podcast/">Pandora Podcast.</a><br></p>

				<a href="http://www.owlmm.com/index.html"><img src="support_files/owl_03.png" style="float: left;" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="5" vspace="0"></a><p><a href="http://www.owlmm.com/index.html">OWL multimedia </a>is a content-based music search tool - it will find music from creative commons labels such as <a href="http://www.magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> and <a href="http://ccmixter.org/">ccMixter</a> that <i>Sound similar</i>
 to your query song.&nbsp; OWL has a nifty interface, you can just drop 
an MP3 file from your collection into OWL - it will quickly analyze a 
song (and it really is quick, less than 2 seconds on my laptop) and then
 give you a list of songs from these creative commons labels that are 
similar - you can play the songs right in your browser too. It seems 
though that the search query is limited to a very small window of about 
10 seconds within a song. The interface is pretty slick, you can filter 
the results by genre, year, license or label - and the integrated Java 
player is quite nice.</p><p>&nbsp;As far as the similarity search goes, I
 was less impressed.&nbsp; I was surprised that for many queries, I 
would receive results with many songs from widely different genres - 
Lute music yielding Electronica, Blues guitar yielding Hip-hop.&nbsp; Of
 course, this is an on-going problem with content-based music similarity
 - what is similar for one listener is not necessarily similar for 
another.&nbsp; Still,&nbsp; I wonder if OWL would do better to model a 
whole song and search based on whole song similarity rather than the 
small window that it is doing.</p><p><img src="support_files/owl.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="580">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Here are some examples of how results OWL produces:<br></p><p><b>Query: </b>First 10 seconds of:&nbsp; Promo Mom - by the Strap Ons - a hard core punk song - search results<br></p><ul><li>Concerto for Violin and Orchestra</li><li>Praeludium in G</li><li>Tentos (no.4)</li><li>Fantasia</li><li>Sonata VIII in C Minor</li></ul><p>These
 are all classical works - not a good match in the bunch.&nbsp; I'm 
guessing that OWL was fooled by the 2 seconds of silence followed by a 
very un-musical shout.&nbsp; So lets try a section in the middle of the 
song where it is all music - so starting at about 30 seconds into 'Promo
 mom' we get the following search results:</p><ul><li>Promo mom by the Strap Ons (it found itself - that's good!)</li><li>Part that ass by the Strap Ons <br></li><li>Chucky got lucky by the Strap Ons</li><li>Function by Somadrone</li><li>Drugs sex violence by the Strap Ons</li></ul><p>This is much better - it found lots of 'Strap On's and the song by Somadrone fit in very well too.<br></p><p>Using the song 'Juke Joint Boogie' - delta blues on guitar - starting at 20 seconds in I got search results with:</p><ul><li>Juke Joint Boogie - it found itself (actually twice, since it was on a compilation cd too)</li><li>Suite no 3 in C Major -a cello piece<br></li><li>Telekonology - an ambient piece<br></li><li>Partita Seconds in sol minore - another cello piece</li></ul><p>It
 looks like OWL has a tendency to match delta blues guitar and cello - 
lets start with cello and see what we get - starting with Partita 
Seconda in Sol Minore&nbsp; by Vito Paternoster we get<br></p><ul><li>&nbsp;Partita Seconda - it finds itself, good!</li><li>Sonata Prima by Vito Paternosta - more cello good</li><li>Suite 5 BMV 1011, prelude by Antonio Meneses - more cello</li></ul><p>So the results for cello sonatas yield more cello sonatas - no clunkers in the first 20 results</p><p>&nbsp;This
 pattern continued for a large number of searches - some yielded very 
good results, while some yielded surprisingly poor results.&nbsp; Often 
times I would receive very different search results if I shifted the 10 
second query window even by a second or two - leading me to conclude 
that they may get better (or at least more stable) results if they use a
 wider query window. </p><p>Perhaps the real goal of OWL is not to find 
songs that sound like a query song - but really to find snippets of 
songs - this would be very useful if you are creating a remix - a tool 
to help you find song fragments that fit in just right with your song 
would be incredibly useful for a remixer - but OWL isn't billing itself 
as a remix tool, it is billing itself as a music discovery tool :</p><blockquote><p><i>Owl's music discovery engine compares your favorite songs to thousands
of others to find similar songs for you to listen to, enjoy, and
purchase.</i></p></blockquote><p>OWL has now found its way onto the <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">search page of creativecommons.org</a>,
 right next to Google, Yahoo and Flickr - a pretty visible spot, so I 
expect that we will be hearing more from OWL - but in the long run, I 
don't expect too much more from them. Rumor is that the music 
technologists/machine learning team behind OWL has moved on to bigger 
and better things - so I don't expect to see much improvement in the 
core similarity engine of OWL. <br></p><p><i>Via <a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003605.shtml">lessig blog</a></i></p><p><i><a href="http://www.lessig.org/blog/archives/003605.shtml"></a></i><br></p>

				<p>It's a good news, bad news kind of thing for <a href="https://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a>

 listeners - the bad news is that they have partnered with<a href="http://radio.msn.com/"> MSN radio</a> to do so.</p><p align="left">MSN
 Radio&nbsp; has been leaking listeners- so they are hoping to stem the 
tide by giving their listeners a more compelling listening 
experience.&nbsp; MSN Radio still has the same set of 3000+ stations, 
but now on their main page is a a launcher for the Pandora player.&nbsp;
 It's the same old Pandora player - placed inside a larger window 
showing Microsoft's advertisements.&nbsp; The music even seems to be 
coming from Pandora and not MSN Radio - so they haven't fully integrated
 Pandora into MSN radio .</p><p align="center"><img src="support_files/msn.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="90%"></p><p>Why is partnering with MSN Radio bad news? Microsoft has a bit of a history trampling over its partners.&nbsp; The recent <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6120272.stm">abandonment</a>
 of its PlayForSure DRM for the Zune left the many MSN customers, audio 
player manufacturers and music service providers very unhappy.&nbsp; 
Hopefully Pandora won't have the same fate. <font size="2"><em>More in the article on CNET - <a href="http://news.com.com/2061-10802_3-6137784.html">MSN, Pandora snyc[sic] online radio</a></em></font><br></p>

				<p>In the post, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/19/replacing-drm-with-a-music-tax-is-incredibly-stupid/">Replacing DRM with a Music Tax is Incredibly Stupid</a>, Mike Arrington at TechCrunch offers his take on the Peter Jenner's <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/03/peter_jenner/">Big Lables are f*cked, and DRM is Dead</a> story in The Register a few weeks back. Mike argues:</p><blockquote><p><i>But I do not think that the government should step in and help these
people. I do not think that we should legislate a tax on broadband
Internet access and mobile phones that gives the music industry
guaranteed revenue, and guaranteed profits, while simultaneously
removing their incentive to innovate and serve niche markets. </i></p><p><i>Asking the government to prop up a dying industry is always (always)
a bad idea. In this case, it is a monumentally stupid, dangerous, and
bad idea.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;Mike makes some good points - but so does Peter Jenner - in the
 end I think we all want a system where users can get easy access to 
music, can share music to whomever, can listen to music on any device 
anywhere, while the artists get fairly compensated for their work.&nbsp;
 How to make that happen is the problem and&nbsp; finding the solution 
is not going to be easy. &nbsp; I'm not sure if we'll find the solution 
in my lifetime - sigh.<br></p>

 The UnSuggester turns the typical recommender on its head.&nbsp; Enter 
the name of a book and recommends book that you are <b>least likey</b> to want to read.&nbsp; Here are a few tries:<br></p><ul><li><b>Critique of pure reason</b> by Immanual Kant - my unsuggestion is<b> Confessions of a shopaholic</b>.</li><li><b>My Life </b>by Bill Clinton - my unsuggestion is <b>Don't wast your life</b> by John Piper</li><li><b>Diplomacy&nbsp; </b>by Henry Kissenger - my unsuggestion is <b>Thud </b>by Terry Pratchett<br></li><li><b>Little women</b> by Louisa May Alcott <b>- </b>my unsuggestion is&nbsp; <b>Smart Mobs: the next social revolution</b> by Howard Rheingold</li><li><b>JavaScript : the definitive guide&nbsp; </b>by David Flanagan - my unsuggestion is&nbsp; <b>The sisterhood of the travelling pants&nbsp; </b>by Ann Brashares&nbsp;</li></ul><p>So
 if you just read a clunker and you are trying to purge your mind of the
 drivel, use the Unsuggester to find the book that is as far away from 
the offender. You can read more about how the UnSuggester works in this <a href="https://www.librarything.com/blog/2006/11/booksuggester-and-unsuggester.php">blog post at the LibraryThing blog</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>The UnSuggester is a fun project put together by <a href="https://www.librarything.com/"><b>LibraryThing</b></a>&nbsp;
 LibraryThing is "an online service to help people catalog their books 
easily. Because everyone catalogs together, you can also use 
LibraryThing to find people with similar libraries, get suggestions from
 people with your tastes and so forth."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="https://www.pandora.com/">Pandora,</a> the popular music recommendation engine, uses trained musicians to analyze music.&nbsp; According to Pandora:</p><blockquote><p>our team of thirty musician-analysts have been listening to music, one
song at a time, studying and collecting literally hundreds of musical
details on every song. It takes 20-30 minutes per song to capture all
of the little details that give each recording its magical sound —
melody, harmony, instrumentation, rhythm, vocals, lyrics… and more —
close to 400 attributes!</p></blockquote><p>Pandora has always been 
secretive about what the 400 attributes are. That's not surprising since
 those attributes are the secret sauce that make Pandora work.&nbsp; I 
notice however that there is now a Wikipedia page called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Music_Genome_Project_attributes">List of Music Genome Project Attribute </a>that
 purports to detail the set of attributes Pandora uses for classifying 
music.&nbsp; It is a pretty interesting list with about 420 different 
attributes.&nbsp; There are over 50 attributes just related to 
vocals,&nbsp; 22 to guitar, 21 to synth.&nbsp; There are&nbsp; a&nbsp; 
few non-content based attributes too, such as:
</p><ul>
<li>Production and Lyrics by Rap Icons</li>
<li>Production and Lyrics by Respected Rap Artists</li>
<li>Production by a Famous Producer</li>
<li>Production by an Iconic Producer</li>
</ul><p>Also interesting are the way they classify lyrics:</p><p></p><table style="width: 713px; height: 304px;" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>Abstract Lyrics</li><li>Ambiguous Lyrics</li><li>Angry Lyrics</li><li>Clean Lyrics</li><li>Erotic Lyrics</li><li>Explicit Lyrics</li><li>Great Lyrics</li><li>Heartbreaking Lyrics</li><li>Humorous Lyrics</li><li>Lyrics by a Famous Rap Artist</li><li>Lyrics with Heavy Erotic Content</li><li>Narrative Lyrics</li><li>Offensive Lyrics</li><li>Political Lyrics</li></ul></td><td style="width: 50%;"><ul><li>Portuguese Lyrics</li><li>Positive, Upbeat Lyrics</li><li>Production and Lyrics by Rap Icons</li><li>Production and Lyrics by Respected Rap Artists</li><li>Religious Lyrics</li><li>Romantic Lyrics</li><li>Sad Lyrics</li><li>Storytelling Lyrics</li><li>Street Talkin' Lyrics</li><li>Surreal Lyrics</li><li>Upbeat Lyrics</li><li>Violent Lyrics</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><p>&nbsp;There certainly are some puzzling bits here, (such as why are Portuguese lyrics the only non-English lyrics mentioned).</p>
<p>I'm not sure how the wikipedia editors developed this list - it may 
be that they've just been capturing the output of the Pandora player 
when it says "I'm playing this song because ..."&nbsp; or perhaps the 
editors have some inside knowledge of the genome - as with most entries 
in the Wikipedia, it is probably best to be a bit of skeptical about the
 content.</p>

				<p>The music discovery tool Musicovery is back on line... it was 
first put up in June, but quickly taken down after it became too popular
 for the site owner to afford. &nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like the site has 
made it to the front page of Digg, which means, once again that it may 
be too popular for its own good,&nbsp; as it doesn't seem to be able to 
stream music right now. Give it a few days, hopefully it will recover. 
It is a pretty neat tool, definitely worth checking out.<br></p><p>Here's what I said back in June ...</p><p>Adam points me to <a target="_self" href="http://musicovery.com/">Musicovery</a>
a music discovery tool similar to MusicPlasma that lets you explore a
music similarity space in a way very similar to MusicPlasma, but with
the added feature that you can actually listen to music.&nbsp; The
similarity to MusicPlasma is not a coincidence, both were developed by&nbsp;
Frederic Vavrille.&nbsp; <br><br><br></p><div align="center"><img src="support_files/musicovery.jpg"><br></div><p><br>The music similarity model seems to be based on a 2D mood scale similar to the <a target="_self" href="http://www.music-cog.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Talks/MIR.2000.oct25/talk.13.html">Thayer mood model.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Musicovery
is a pretty compelling music discovery tool.&nbsp; It is the only
interactive tool that allows you to listen to music (sites like last.fm
and Pandora give you a linear, one-song-at-a-time experience due to
internet streaming licensing requirements).&nbsp; I'm not sure how
Musicovery is licensing their music to allow interactive play like
this, but it is a clear improvement over the Pandora/Last.fm style. I
hope we'll see more sites like this.<br><br>There's absolutely no
supporting documentation on the site so it is hard to tell how things
work, how their similarity is determined (automatically, socially or by
human editors), nor is it clear how deep the music catalog (although
there seems to be&nbsp; a wide range of genres covered).<br><br>I was never
a fan of MusicPlasma, I though it was slow, the similarity was trivial
and you couldn't listen to the music.&nbsp; Now Musicovery has addressed all
of these issues giving us a compelling music discovery tool that is
fast, uses an interesting notion of similarity and&nbsp; most important of
all, lets you listen and interact with the music.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 stars</span> <br></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Whenever I receive a recommendation for a book from Amazon or a 
song from last.fm or a movie from Netflix, I like to know why they are 
recommending the item.&nbsp; They could be recommending it because I've 
purchased books by the same author, or listened to songs by the same 
artist - it could be that I have tastes similar to someone else who 
liked that item, or it could be that the company has received money from
 someone to recommend the item, or perhaps someone has figured out how 
to game the recommendation engine to give preference to their items. 
&nbsp;</p><p>If I am going to use a recommender I have to trust it, and 
in order for me to start trusting a recommender the recommender has to 
give me some idea as to why I am receiving the 
recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some recommender systems already do 
this.&nbsp; Pandora for instance, gives a good description of why they 
are recommending music -with statements such as&nbsp; "this song has 
prominent drums,R &amp; B Influences and a Reggae Feel" .&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But most recommenders don't give you any idea.&nbsp; My favorite example
 is this recommendation from Amazon:</p><p align="center"><img src="support_files/61664428_ae51cbf6c8.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For some reason, Amazon has decided that there's a link between scabs, breasts and Coldplay.</p><p>Cameron
 Marlow, a researcher at Yahoo's lab has an excellent post about how 
recommenders are getting a clue about giving a clue - how there's a 
trend in recommenders to give an explanation as to why an item was 
recommended.&nbsp; Cameron rightly points out that <i>Explanation creates understanding and understanding leads to trust.</i><strike> (and trust leads to suffering ... (<i>whoops -wrong quote</i>)).</strike></p><p>Check out Cameron's blog post on overstated.net:<a href="http://overstated.net/2006/11/09/explanatory-algorithms"> Explanatory Algorithms</a></p><p><a href="http://overstated.net/2006/11/09/explanatory-algorithms"></a>(tip of the hat to <a href="http://mediadescri.be/">Adam)</a><br></p>
