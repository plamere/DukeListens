			<h3><a href="slacker_kick_back_and_listen.html" title="permalink">Slacker - Taking Internet Radio on the road</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Today at SXSW, <a href="http://slacker.com/">Slacker</a> will be 
launched.&nbsp; Slacker is an online radio, similar to Pandora - type in
 the names of a few artists that you like and Slacker will feed you a 
continuous stream of music related to those artists.&nbsp; Nothing new 
here so far, many folks have been doing the same thing for years.&nbsp; 
The novel thing that Slacker is bringing to the table is that they will 
let you take Internet Radio on the road. &nbsp; </p><p><br>This summer 
Slacker will be releasing an iPod-like device (yes, real hardware) that 
will allow you to sync up and take an Internet Radio station on the 
road.&nbsp; The device will presumably enforce the same rules that we 
have with Internet radio - no playing a song or artist on demand, no 
unlimited song skipping.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007/03/14/slacker-music-device-and-service-via-internet-satellite/">Engadet describes the device</a> as such:&nbsp; <em>Slacker will provide a internet radio network that won't just reach you
via browser, but will also stream to a Slacker portable by way of WiFi
and -- get this -- satellite service.</em> <em>The Slacker player, which will feature a massive 4-inch screen with
scrolling touch strip and debut this summer in varying capacities
between 2, 4, and 8GB up to 120GB for between $150 and $350, will have
track metadata via AMG, and gobbles up and plays back audio content via
WiFi and USB (with tracks purchasable for $1). The satellite part comes
into play with a docking station at home or in the car, so you can get
Slacker content while on the move or if you're out of range of internet
access.</em></p><p>Right now,&nbsp; slacker is in beta, and only the free, web radio is live.&nbsp; The web radio, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/digitalentertainment/2007/03/13/slacker-ipod-music-tech-cx_df_0313slacker.html">Forbes,</a>&nbsp;
 will use (gulp!) audio ads (something that Pandora experimented with 
and very quickly abandoned).&nbsp; The web player is rather slick, and 
easy to use.&nbsp; However, the music choices it made were rather 
pedestrian.&nbsp; I'm guessing that they rely on All Music's similar 
artist data to drive their radio stations, which give serviceable 
recommendations, but lacks the subtlety and aha! factor of Pandora or 
last.fm.&nbsp; Right now I am listening to 'The Nice' radio, which 
should be filled with raucous Hammond B3 and bad vocals, but instead I'm
 hearing a rather pedestrian selection of the Beatles, Cream and Traffic
 (yawn!). Pandora, on the other hand, knows that The Nice has a 
'electric rock instrumentation with prominent organ' (prominent organ 
indeed!) and plays similar sounding tracks. Last.fm, with its social 
recommender offers a track by Renaissance that I've never heard before, 
but sounds like it could have been recorded by the Nice.&nbsp; Now 
that's what a good music recommender should do.</p><p>Slacker is in 
beta, and their Big Idea, taking Internet Radio on the road is not ready
 yet, so we'll cut them some slack ;) - but I hope they learn that the 
key to good Internet radio is interesting and highly relevant music 
recommendations.</p><p><img src="support_files/slacker.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="100%"><br></p><p><br></p>

				<p>Social tags and music are a natural fit. People tag songs and 
artists with all sorts of interesting tags related to genre, mood, 
instrumentation and so on.&nbsp; One of the stranger music tags I've 
encountered on last.fm is '<a href="https://www.last.fm/tag/lazy%20eye">lazy-eye</a>'.&nbsp;
 19 different people have applied this tag nearly 200 times.&nbsp; This 
tag has been applied to Barry Manilow, Cookie Monster, Momus and 
others.&nbsp; I do wonder what the motivation is for someone to tag an 
artist as 'lazy eye'.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it does make for some very 
eclectic listening. So feel free to have a listen to some lazy-eye 
radio: <br></p>

				<p><a href="https://pandora.com/"><img style="float: right;" src="support_files/logo_pandora.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0">Pandora</a>
 is a cool way to discover music - the Pandora radio gives consistent 
high quality music that is similar to music that you already know and 
like.&nbsp; However, if you like Classical music, you are out of luck 
with Pandora - there's no Classical music in the Pandora catalog. &nbsp;
 Pandora knows this is a problem for many listeners and is doing 
something about it.&nbsp; Last month, Steve Hogan of Pandora posted this
 in response to a <a href="http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2006/02/pandora_21.html">comment</a> about classical music on the Pandora blog:<br></p><blockquote><i>We do intend to make classical music available through Pandora. We're
currently developing a music genome for this purpose and we'll have to
populate it with enough music to create a satisfying listening
experience. I can tell you there is a lot of enthusiasm within the
company to offer classical music to our users - this is a large
undertaking but it will be well worth the wait!</i></blockquote><p>The intention to add classical music to Pandora was echoed in the recent <a href="http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2006/02/pandora_21.html">Pandora Podcast </a>as well.&nbsp;</p><p>I
 do hope that they don't segregate Classical music away from all of the 
rock/pop and alternative music in Pandora.&nbsp; I'd love to hear a 
playlist that&nbsp; segues between a song like Eleanor Rigby and a 
Mozart string quartet.&nbsp; And I hope that Pandora manages to roll out
 their Classical collection before the <a href="http://blog.pandora.com/pandora/archives/2007/03/riaas_new_royal.html">RIAA manages to kill online radio</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>I live in New Hampshire, where we (still) have the 
first-in-the-nation Presidential primary. &nbsp; With only a year to go 
before the primary, the candidates are starting to arrive in full 
force.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday, while I was taking a walk though the town 
I&nbsp; saw a hustle and bustle outside of the local chocolate shop. I 
recognized <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,1180,00.html">Carl Cameron</a>
 - Fox news political reporter - something was definitely up.&nbsp; 
Asking around I found out that Senator Hillary Clinton was about to make
 a 'surprise' visit for some hot chocolate.&nbsp; I waited along with 
about 20 reporters (I noticed after a few minutes that I was standing 
next to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1930401">Mara Liasson</a> of NPR).&nbsp; While waiting, I chatted with Chris Fitzgerald,&nbsp; a photographer from <a href="http://candidatephotos.com/Default.aspx">CandidatePhotos.com</a>
 - a free-lance photo site that sells photos of candiates to all of the 
major news organizations.&nbsp;  He took some good photos of the 
event:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.candidatephotos.com/Common/PhotoDetailPage.aspx?msa=0&amp;pid=7982377&amp;slid=6ef4d01a-554a-4306-8bc6-77a531d5bc28&amp;slididx=1&amp;lid=0&amp;rstid=284fe231-7fb9-4c21-91ee-e1310f075432&amp;aid=1">Photo of Hillary in New Hampshire </a><br></p><p>Hillary
 finally arrived. She was gracious, she took her time walking through 
the crowd, signing autographs, shaking hands, and chatting with people 
and even kissing babies. &nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, it was a fun way to 
spend an hour watching the out-of-state candidates get mobbed by the 
out-of-state press, each trying to find a local New Hampshirite to talk 
to (hint - he's the guy wearing the red flannel shirt).<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

				I writing a little web app using the nifty <a href="https://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit </a>(it
 is a really nice bit of work) when I received a very troubling warning 
from the GWT compiler&nbsp; - I was using Java 1.5 language features (in
 particular, Generics) while the GWT only <a href="https://code.google.com/webtoolkit/documentation/com.google.gwt.doc.DeveloperGuide.Fundamentals.JavaToJavaScriptCompiler.LanguageSupport.html">supports Java 1.4</a>.&nbsp; This was going to be a real big problem, since I was hooking the web app to the <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/AST/Green_Search_Paper_final.pdf">AST Search Engine </a>which
 uses Java 1.5 features in its interface.&nbsp; This could be a deal 
breaker.&nbsp; But I soldiered on, thinking that if I confined my 1.5 
code to the server side (where I was interacting with the search 
engine), but kept the client and any Java code that was to be shipped 
over a wire in 1.4 things might work - and sure enough it did. So if you
 are considering GWT, don't be put off by the Java 1.4 restrictions - 
once you are running on the server, you can use 1.5 to your heart's 
content.&nbsp;&nbsp;

				<p>This is a big deal.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.kurthanson.com/archive/news/030207/index.shtml">RAIN</a> (The Radio and Internet Newsletter) the Copyright Royalty Board has adopted the 'pay per play' rate proposed by <span class="body_regular"><a href="http://www.soundexchange.com/" target="_blank"><b>SoundExchange</b></a>(the digital music royalty collection body created by the <a href="https://www.riaa.com/" target="_blank"><b>RIAA</b></a>). The royalty fees are so high that they will likely drive most of the&nbsp; Internet radio stations (such as our favorite <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a>) right off the air.&nbsp; Bill Goldsmith, the creator of Radio Paradise says:</span></p><blockquote><p><i>For some time, we've suffered with a system where we pay a large chunk
(10%-12%) of our income to the Big 5 record companies - while FM
stations and radio conglomerates like Clear Channel
pay nothing. Now they want even more. In our case, <b>an amount equal to 125% of our income</b>.&nbsp; </i></p></blockquote><p><i></i>This will also likely have a tremendous negative impact on companies like <a href="https://www.pandora.com/">Pandora,</a> that thrive on customized radio streams.&nbsp; The new licensing fees include a <i>per channel</i>
 cost which may mean that each customized radio stream that Pandora 
serves may cost them a $500 minimum.&nbsp; That's $500 for each of their
 many millions of listeners.&nbsp; (UK based last.fm on the other hand, 
may not be affected by this at all).</p><p>An excellent analysis of the 
new rates and their impact on a typical Internet broadcaster (along with
 some really good commentary) can be found at <a href="http://www.save-internet-radio.com/2007/03/02/save-internet-radio/">Save Internet Radio</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hypebot.com/"></a><br></p>

				<p>Over the last few days, I've been looking at building a song 
lyric similarity model.&nbsp; The idea is to build a system that can 
find songs that have similar lyrics to a seed song.&nbsp; This is 
useful, for instance, when you want to generate playlists that have some
 cohesive theme.&nbsp; </p><p>This is a pretty simple idea, but it can 
be difficult to implement.&nbsp; First, you need a search engine that 
can efficiently determine document similarity for a large number of 
documents.&nbsp; Second, you need access to lots and lots of 
lyrics.&nbsp; Now, I am pretty lucky in that I work with the Advanced 
Search Technologies folks here in Sun Labs.&nbsp; The AST team has 
developed an <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/dashboard.php?id=101">incredible search engine</a>
 that will let me do all sorts of neat things - document similarity 
being one of them.&nbsp; With this search engine, I can index the lyrics
 of each song as a document and then make simple queries to find similar
 documents.&nbsp; It's fast, it is well architected, and it's written in
 Java.</p><p><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Main_Page" title="LyricWiki"><img src="support_files/lyricwiki_050806.jpg" style="float: left;" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>So,
 I have a search engine that will do the heavy lifting - but without 
lyric data, the search engine would have nothing to do.&nbsp; So where 
can I get a whole lot of lyric data?&nbsp; Why <a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Main_Page">LyricWiki</a>
 of course! LyricWiki is a wikipedia-style song lyric site, that (unlike
 most lyric sites) provides lyrics without a flood of invasive ads. 
LyricWiki has a nice clean Wiki-style interface, and they provide a soap
 interface to their data.&nbsp; With the soap interface, I could easily 
crawl the site to build up a nice database of lyrics. However, it seemed
 like it might be a bit anti-social to do that, so I contacted Sean 
Colombo, the creator of LyricWiki. I explained to him the kind of thing I
 wanted to do, and he graciously offered to give me a dump of his entire
 database!&nbsp; What a super thing for him to do!</p><p>So armed with a
 world-class search engine and 300,000 (!) song lyrics, I've been able 
to build a song lyric similarity engine.&nbsp; It is pretty neat. First 
of all, it does a great job of finding song covers (duh!).&nbsp; But it 
also works well at generating themed playlists.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,
 I used <b><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Led_Zeppelin:Gallows_Pole" title="Led Zeppelin:Gallows Pole">Led Zeppelin's Gallows Pole</a></b> as a query.&nbsp; Here's the resulting playlist, filled with songs that will make you swing (in the worst sense of swing).<br></p><ul><li><b><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Peter%2C_Paul_%26_Mary:Hangman" title="Peter, Paul &amp; Mary:Hangman">Peter, Paul &amp; Mary:Hangman</a></b></li><li> <b><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Robert_Plant:Hey_Joe" title="Robert Plant:Hey Joe">Robert Plant: Hey Joe</a></b></li><li> <b><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Dust_For_Life:The_End" title="Dust For Life:The End">Dust for life: The End</a></b></li><li> <b><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/The_Walkabouts:Hang_Man" title="The Walkabouts:Hang Man">The Walkabouts: Hang_Man</a></b></li><li><b><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Smog:Hangman_Blues">Smog: Hangman blues</a></b> </li><li><b><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Bay_Laurel:We_Lost">Bay Laurel: We Lost</a></b></li><li><b><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Samael:Worship_Him">Samael: Worship him</a></b></li></ul>This is fun stuff - I'd love to figure out how to make this available for people to play with. Perhaps I'll create a <a href="http://www.xspf.org/">XSPF</a>-generating
 web site and web service that will give you these playlists.&nbsp; Let 
me know if you are interested in such a thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font size="2">Much thanks to Steve and Jeff for help with the search engine, and to Sean for all of the lyrics.</font></i><br>

				Rumors are afloat that Viacom is in negotiations to purchase last.fm
 for $450 million.&nbsp; That's a whole lot of money!&nbsp; Last.fm is 
such a super music discovery site, I wish Martin, RJ, Norman and all of 
the last.fm crew the best, and I hope they do well - but I really worry 
what will happen to last.fm should Viacom take the reins. (via <a href="http://getcha.info/?p=21">Getcha Info!)</a>
