An&nbsp; <a href="http://digitalmusic.weblogsinc.com/2006/06/19/the-digital-aandr-man/" target="_self">article</a>&nbsp; in the Digital Music Weblog describes the <a href="http://www.platinumblueinc.com/" target="_self">Platinum Blue Music Intelligence system</a> that claims to provide a <span style="font-style: italic;">crystal ball&nbsp;</span> for the music industry .&nbsp;&nbsp; According to Platinum Blue they can<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font color="#000000" size="3"><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-style: italic;">"detect
and analyze the underlying mathematical patterns contained in a song.
This knowledge, encompassing 30+ parameters including, pitch, melody
and cadence, allows a song to be easily compared to other songs. In
this way, the music market, which has often seemed the purview of the
alchemist, is now open to rational analysis."</span></font></font><br style="font-style: italic;"></div><br>Platinum Blue is not the first company to make a system that tries to predict hit songs.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hitsongscience.com/" target="_self">Hit Song Science</a> also has a system that can tell you whether a song 'sounds like' a hit song.<br><br>Similarly, in the academic world, there have been some investigations along these lines.&nbsp; ISMIR 2005 published "<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=6&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hpl.hp.com%2Ftechreports%2F2005%2FHPL-2005-149.pdf&amp;ei=zGqaRLuZBsjcaN3ThOkC&amp;sig2=2IaVGKdsjiEVQhiB4Lv_2Q" target="_self">Automatic Prediction of Hit Songs</a>"
 by Beth Logan.&nbsp; In this paper, Beth describes using Support Vector
 Machines and boosting classifiers to explore if there is some 
distinguisable thread connecting hit songs.&nbsp; Her results were 
'better than random' and that lyric features were more effective than 
audio features for predicting hits.&nbsp; She concludes by saying that 
there is indeed some distinguishable thread connecting hit songs and 
that one cannot simply dismiss claims by commercial ventures such as '<span style="font-style: italic;">Hit Song Science"&nbsp; </span>as impossible.<br><br>Personally,
 I think that in today's music world, a 'hit' is much more dependent on 
the facial features and figure of the performer than the music or lyric 
content.&nbsp; Even more important (and even less measurable) is the 
social network that a song percolates through.&nbsp; In the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393325423/sr=8-1/qid=1150972450/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-9307366-9076063?%5Fencoding=UTF8" target="_self">Six Degrees - The Science of the Connected age,</a>
 Duncan Watts observes that a new idea (or a new song) is like a seed or
 trigger.&nbsp; Seeds of change, like their biological counterparts are a
 dime a dozen.&nbsp; Only one in a million may grow to fruition and <br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">... not because that one bears some special unique quality, but because it <span style="font-style: italic;">lands in the right place</span>.&nbsp;
 So it is for social seeds as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes success 
difficult to predict is that success has less to do with the particular 
vision than with the pattern of interactions into the midsts of which 
their pinprick falls.&nbsp; In other words, the success of a song has 
less to do with the music, and more to do with the social network that 
the song moves through."<br></div><br>&nbsp;Duncan says that the 
difference between a hugely successful innovation and an abject failure 
can be generated entirely through the dynamics of interactions between 
players who might have nothing to do with its introduction.&nbsp; In a 
world where individuals make decisions based not only on their own 
judgements but also on the judgements of others, quality is not enough.<br><br>So
 perhaps the best thing that these automated hit detectors can do is to 
tell us which songs have no possibility to become a hit.&nbsp; They can 
be the Simon, Randy and Paula that tell us which songs don't have a 
chance, the songs that should pack up their things and go back to 
Smalltown Arkansas. <br>

			<h3><a href="how_many_itunes_songs_have.html" title="permalink">How many iTunes songs have *you* bought?</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				
<br>Sometime during the first quarter of 2006 Apple sold its 50 
millionth iPod.&nbsp; Right around the same time, Apple celebrated 
selling its 1 <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/1billion/" target="_self">*billionth*</a>
 song on iTunes.&nbsp; A phenomenal achievement.&nbsp; Or was it?&nbsp; 
Dividing the the billion songs by the 50 million iPods yields a grand 
total of an average of 20 songs sold by Apple per iPod.&nbsp; So after 
spending $200 or $300 or even more on a luxury music player, the average
 person is only spending $20 to put iTunes music on it.<br><br>I've had 
an iPod for a couple of years now. I have probably about 5,000 songs on 
it.&nbsp; I have always considered myself atypical in that I had 
purchased just a handful of songs from iTunes.&nbsp; A quick check shows
 that I have purchased only 51 songs from iTunes, less than two per 
month.&nbsp; However, this means that I purchase iTunes songs&nbsp; 2.5 
times the rate of the average iPod owner.&nbsp; So instead of being a 
rare iTunes shopper, I'm a frequent buyer!&nbsp; <br><br>One has to 
wonder if Apple is making any money from those billion 
songs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the typical iPod user is just buying one iTunes 
song per month, the credit card transaction fees have to be eating up 
any potential profits.<br><br>Now, if Apple decided to offer an 
all-you-can-eat plan like Napster or Yahoo, I'm guessing that they'd be 
able to convert a non-insignificant fraction of their 50 million iPod 
owners to $10 per month subscribers.&nbsp; At the same time, the 
Napsters, Yahoos and Rhapsodies are hoping that the <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2006/06/19/Pressure_still_on_for_Apples_DRM/" target="_self">DRM flap</a>
 that Apple is facing in Europe will end with Apple being forced to open
 up their DRM, if&nbsp; that happens, Apple may be forced to compete and
 will finally offer up their own subscription service.<br><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span>I've
 been listening to podcasts ever since iTunes made it easy to load them 
on my iPod.&nbsp; I'm subscribed to probably 20 or 30 podcasts, but I 
regularly listen to only&nbsp; a few.&nbsp; These span the range from 
tech, to movies to music. Some of my favorites are:<br><br><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href="https://revision3.com/diggnation" target="_self">Diggnation</a>
 - Kevin Rose of Digg.com fame and sidekick Alex Albrecht drinks beer 
and talks about the most popular stores on Digg.&nbsp; Its like going 
out for a beer with&nbsp; a couple of geek friends and talking about 
slashdot (well, it is more interesting than it sounds).</li><li><a href="http://filmspotting.net/" target="_self">Filmspotting</a>
 - (Formerly Cinecast) - what a movie review show should be. Two guys 
who really like movies talk about their favorites and along the way 
teach a little bit about cinema.</li><li><a href="http://javaposse.com/" target="_self">Java Posse</a> - All Java all the time. Latest Java news and trends.</li><li><a href="http://gillmorgang.podshow.com/" target="_self">Gillmor Gang</a>
 - Skip the first five minutes, and listen to these guys opine about the
 state of IT, the web, and the players.&nbsp; Steve Gillmor, the host, 
is probably the most cantankerous guy you'll ever hear, but all of the 
other guests stick to their guns and argue their points convincingly. 
Suprisingly, I learn quite a bit from this show.</li><li><a href="https://twit.tv/" target="_self">TWIT</a>
 - This Week in Tech - Part of the Leo Laporte Podcasting empire, a 
panel show where various podcasters talk about the week's tech news. <br></li><li><a href="https://twit.tv/itn25" target="_self">Inside the Net</a> - Part of the TWIT network ... weekly interviews with the movers and shakers in the web 2.0 world</li><li><a href="http://andrewkeen.typepad.com/aftertv/" target="_self">AfterTV-</a> converstations about media, culture and technology.

songs have an interesting place in the world of Music Information 
Retrieval.&nbsp; A good cover song is very similar to the original in 
one axis, but usually very different on another axis. As such they 
provide&nbsp; excellent examples of the difficulties inherent in music 
similarity.&nbsp; A cover is clearly similar to the original (its ths 
same song!), but is still very different (think about Devo's cover of 
the Rolling Stones (I can't get no) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%28I_Can%27t_Get_No%29_Satisfaction" target="_self">Satisfaction</a>).<br><br>MIR researcher Doug Eck put together an excellent demonstration: T<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eeckdoug/favorite_things/index.html" target="_self">he Many Moods of My Favorite Things. </a>that collects a number of different versions of the Sound of Music classic.<br><br>Affirming the importance of covers in MIR, this year's <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/mirex2006/index.php/Main_Page" target="_self">MIREX</a>
 (Music Information Evaluation eXchange) (the TREC of MIR) is 
considering offering a 'cover song contest', where the goal is, given a 
seed song, find the cover song among hundreds of other songs.&nbsp; It's
 an interesting problem ... I'm not sure how the traditional machine 
learning techniques will apply to this task. <br><br>I saw on digg.com that WMFU has put together a <a href="http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2006/05/stairways_to_he.html" target="_self">list of 101 covers of the venerable stadium classic: Stairway to Heaven</a>.&nbsp; There's version by Dolly Parton, Frank Zappa, Dread Zeppelin, the London Symphony and <a href="http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/KF/2006/05/led/Mary%20_Schneider_Yodels_-_Stairway_To_Heaven.mp3">Mary Schneider, Yodeling Queen of Australia</a>, as well as the infamous <a href="http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/KF/2006/05/led/Little_Roger_and_the_Goosebumps_-_Stairway_To_Gilligans_Island.mp3" target="_self">Gilligan's Island</a> version.&nbsp; The version by the <a href="http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/KF/2006/05/led/Hard-Ons_-_Stairway_to_Heaven.mp3" target="_self">Hard-ons</a> will make anyone who has ever worked in a music store wince from the memory of every 15-year-old trying out a guitar. &nbsp;

				<br>Adam points me to <a href="http://musicovery.com/" target="_self">Musicovery</a>
 a music discovery tool similar to MusicPlasma that lets you explore a 
music similarity space in a way very similar to MusicPlasma, but with 
the added feature that you can actually listen to music.&nbsp; The 
similarity to MusicPlasma is not a coincidence, both were developed 
by&nbsp; Frederic Vavrille.&nbsp; <br><br><br><img src="support_files/musicovery.jpg"><br><br>The music similarity model seems to be based on a 2D mood scale similar to the <a href="http://www.music-cog.ohio-state.edu/Huron/Talks/MIR.2000.oct25/talk.13.html" target="_self">Thayer mood model.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Musicovery
 is a pretty compelling music discovery tool.&nbsp; It is the only 
interactive tool that allows you to listen to music (sites like last.fm 
and Pandora give you a linear, one-song-at-a-time experience due to 
internet streaming licensing requirements).&nbsp; I'm not sure how 
Musicovery is licensing their music to allow interactive play like this,
 but it is a clear improvement over the Pandora/Last.fm style. I hope 
we'll see more sites like this.<br><br>There's absolutely no supporting 
documentation on the site so it is hard to tell how things work, how 
their similarity is determined (automatically, socially or by human 
editors), nor is it clear how deep the music catalog (although there 
seems to be&nbsp; a wide range of genres covered).<br><br>I was never a 
fan of MusicPlasma, I though it was slow, the similarity was trivial and
 you couldn't listen to the music.&nbsp; Now Musicovery has addressed 
all of these issues giving us a compelling music discovery tool that is 
fast, uses an interesting notion of similarity and&nbsp; most important 
of all, lets you listen and interact with the music.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">5 stars!<br><br></span>

head-to-head comparison of 8 music recommenders: MusicStrands, 
LivePlasma, UpTo11.net, Audiri, Pandora, Mercora, Yahoo LAUNCHcast 
Radio, and last.fm.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, last.fm gets the nod. Here's
 what they say:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><font style="font-style: italic;" face="arial" size="2">Last.fm is by far the best out there,
possessing a huge library of music, a great community, and a
recommendation feature that will blow you away. Last.fm pretty much
sweeps our five main criteria.<br><br></font></div>Check the article out here:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1558,1967383,00.asp?kc=ETRSS02129TX1K0000532" target="_self">Free Music Recommendation Services</a>.&nbsp; (<span style="font-style: italic;">first seen on digg.com)<br><br></span>

now, most of you have probably seen the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/gear.html" target="_self">Nike + iPod sport kit</a> that
lets you use your iPod nano as a multi-hundred dollar pedometer.&nbsp;
The feature that seems to be missing, that any MIR fan will be looking
for, is the 'query by cadence' ... that is, having the iPod pick songs
that match your pace.&nbsp; When you are running up that long
hill,&nbsp; a slower song should be queued up, and when you are going
down the other side, a much faster song should be played.&nbsp; Or
perhaps they should include a heart rate monitor too, so when you
approach heart-attack territory, the iPod can start playing Roberta
Flack or Norah Jones.&nbsp; And the real question is, what happens when
you wear your Nike/iPod sneakers with wireless transmitter to the airport?</td></tr></tbody></table>

 the playground you can browse around their online music collection 
(about 30,000 tracks), listen to clips of songs, and most interestingly,
 get a set of 'similar sounding' tracks using the MusicIP song 
similarity engine.&nbsp; It's a pretty light-weight way to try out their
 similarity system.&nbsp; For the most part, the playground gives you an
 interesting similarity set, but does give a clunker every once in a 
while (does Led Zep's 'Immigrant Song' really sound like 'Just Don't 
tell Me That' by N'Sync?&nbsp; <br><br>Check it out, it is a pretty well-polished interface.<br>
