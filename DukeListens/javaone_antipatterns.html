			<h2>JavaOne Antipatterns</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>At JavaOne this year I went to a lot of talks, at least 30 of 
them.&nbsp; After a few of them I started to notice some very bad 
patterns, antipatterns if you will, in many of the talks.&nbsp; These 
are things one should never hear or see in a talk. JavaOne was filled 
with them, even from some very high profile speakers, from some very 
visible companies (and yes, many of them were from Sun).&nbsp; If you 
are going to give a talk at JavaOne, please don't adopt these practices:</p><ul><li>Give
 the same talk as last year.&nbsp; Yep, I saw two very well attended 
talks (1,000+) attendees, where the subject matter (and even the slides)
 of the talk was the same as last year's talk.</li><li>Tell us about 
your broken demo - if you are not showing&nbsp; a demo because it is 
broken, don't even bother telling us about it.&nbsp; One talk had 4 
demos in the slides, but 3 of them were missing, broken, or never 
written.</li><li>Tell us your demo is cool.&nbsp; I'll be the judge of 
what I think is&nbsp; cool.&nbsp; One talk started with the speaker 
telling us he was going to 'knock our socks off', yawn.<br></li><li>Tell
 us you are skipping content because you ran out of time - If you are 
running out of time, adapt, but don't narrate the process.</li><li>Forget what was in your talk.&nbsp; During one very high profile talk, the speaker got to a slide that said <b>Demo</b>.
 The speaker said ... hmmm I wrote these slides two months ago,&nbsp; 
I'm not sure what I was thinking about when I wrote this slide. My 
advice - practice your talk, if you find a&nbsp; slide for a demo that 
you can't remember, delete the slide (they let you delete slides right 
up until your talk).</li></ul><br>

                I totally agree. I was amazed at the lack of polish and 
professionalism in a few talks. This is unacceptable at a conference 
which costs north of $2400 to attend.

                I agree, one of the general guidelines at least on the 
tracks I was a reviewer on was to ask the question 'could this talk have
 been given last year', if the answer is yes then that's a mark against 
the talk.

Of course, with things like Spring, you have duplicates and the same 
boring old content, but people love it, so clearly there's a strong 
demand for it, so there's a measure of compromise involved.
