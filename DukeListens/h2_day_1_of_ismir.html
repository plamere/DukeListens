			<h2>ISMIR  - Day one</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>

So lets talk about ISMIR. This year's ISMIR is being hosted by Queen
Mary University of London and Goldsmiths College, University of London.
This year ISMIR has some corporate sponsors including Microsoft research,
Hewlett Packard, Philips Research,  and Sun Microsystems.  ISMIR is
starting to be recognized in the industrial/commercial world as an
important conference in today's world of digital music. (It has
already been recognized as such in the academic world).
</p><p>
About 230 people are attending ISMIR this year, representing 25
countries.  The proceedings are over 700 pages long (and add to the
amount of exercise I've been getting as I lug this precious volume up
and down the streets of London).
</p><p>
One of the themes of this year's ISMIR seems to be <i>Let's hook up
the music technologists with the musicologists</i> Indeed, these two
groups, musicologists and technologist have not really collaborated
too much in the MIR community which causes endless difficulties and
duplication of effort. For instance, recently on the MUSIC-IR mailing
list, there's been a debate about the usefulness of music
genre classification (and the use of genre in general).  It was
pointed out (several times) today that it would be wise (and a heck of a lot
easier) to just ask the musicologists how to deal with genre and all the
problems it is causing since musicologists have experience
answering just this this sort of question.  This theme of improved
communication and cooperation were outlined in the
opening talk by Nicholas Cook, a Research Professor of Music, at Royal
Holloway, University of London. Professor Cook warned  that
although computers have been a useful tools by musicologists for quite
sometime, it is important to remember that the listening experience is
an essential part of music analysis, and that with 'computer
musicology' we are in danger of losing that.
</p><p>

</p><p>
One of my favorite talks of the day was by <b>Jin Ha Lee</b> from the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She talked about a very
interesting problem that I didn't even know existed.  Imagine hearing
music from another culture. If you really like the music, you might
want to hear more of the music, or you may want to learn more about
the artist or the genre of this new music. Jin Ha points out that
since all of our music search tools are text based we have no real way
of forming queries for this music.  We may not understand the lyrics,
we certainly don't recognize the genre, we don't recognize the artist,
we may not even understand the mood (since the mood of a song is often
conveyed in the lyrics). Jin Ha suggests that for cross
cultural/multilingual music information seeking, the best approaches
for music search may be non-language queries such as query by example,
query based upon music similarity, culturally neutral labels.
</p><p>
<b>Gerhard Widmer</b> from Johannes Kepler University described some
interesting work involving data mining the web for co-occurrence of artists using
a technique similar to Google's pagerank for discovering 'prototypical
artists', that is, those that are the best representative for their
particular genre. Some of the difficulties with mining the web are
dealing with bands that have names that are also common words. Bands
such as Queen, Kiss and Yes get skewed statistics because of their
common names.  I didn't dare ask how they'd deal with the band "the
the".
</p><p> <b>Ian Knopke</b> of McGill presented some early work in the geospatial
location of music and sound files.  Ian has a web crawler designed to
find music and then uses a number of techniques to discover where
physically the data is located.
</p><p>
<b>Thomas Lidy</b> presented some excellent research on how to evaluate
feature extractors and psychoacoustic transformations for music genre
classification. Thomas was able to show how their rhythm histogram led
to genre classification accuracy improvements.  I wonder about some of
the testing methodology though. I think some of the test data sets
were too small, or Thomas's classifier was over-fitting because there
was some unexplained large difference in accuracy across different
data sets.  This highlights one of the trouble spots for audio
classification ... there just isn't enough data for testing and
training systems. The copyright problems make it very hard to get an
adequate sized, labelled collection that researchers can share.
</p><p>
<b>Cory McKay</b> of McGill described the framework for optimizing music
classification that they've been building. Cory and others have been
building ACE, the Autonomous Classification Engine.  Given a set of
features, ACE will try a number of classifiers, tuning parameters,
classifier ensembles and other techniques to try to optimize the
classification.  ACE is written in Java and is released  (or will be
soon) under the GPL. ACE looks really interesting. It will be a great
tool for anyone trying to improve music classification algorithms. I
expect that ACE will help raise the bar in a number of classification
tasks at next years MIREX.  The McGill team is also releasing several
other open source Java-based packages for use by MIR developers.
With these contributions, McGill is really adding value to the MIR community.
Go McGill!

</p><p>
<b>Audo to Score</b>There were a number of talks in the 'audio to score' track describing
techniques for extracting pitch, onset, and harmonic content directly
from audio.  These are probably some of the most mathematically
intensive talks of the conference, .. the math was flowing .. at one
point a slide was shown with probably 10 separate formula, with the
speaker comment of "and then some math occurs and then ...".  Two
separate papers presented by students from the University of Tokyo
involved pitch extraction.  There was an interesting audio demo of
converting an audio stream to MIDI data. These system were able to
deal with harmonies generated by piano and guitar quite well.
</p><p>
</p><h3> Monday Posters </h3>
During lunch time we were able to review a number of posters while we
munched on our sandwiches and finger food.  There were just too many
posters for me to get a chance to talk to all of the presenters, but I
did talk to a few folks. Some highlights:
<ul>
<li>  <b> Playsom</b> Robert Neumayer was demonstrating his PlaySom
system. PlaySom is a user interface that allows the user to browse a
large music collection by navigating a map of clustered music tracks.
This approach provides a potentially better way to find and build
playlists on small devices.
</li><li> <b> Sonixplorer</b> A system that uses visualization and
auralization for content-based music exploration of music collections.
Dominik Lubbers showed a clustering system where aural browsing of
music collections were possible.
</li><li> <b><a href="http://foafing-the-music.iua.upf.edu/"> Foafing the Music</a></b> This system uses 'friend of a friend'
and RSS for recommending music depending on the users personal tastes.
This system, developed by folks at Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona Spain
mines data from RSS feeeds including Audioscrobbler as well as based
upon the content of the music (i.e. content-based music similarity).
</li><li> <b>Rebecca Fiebrink</b> was describing her work on using genetic
algorithms for determine feature weighting for music classification.  You can try it out
<a href="http://mtg100.upf.es/foafing-the-music/index.html"> at their website.</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
The day ended at about 6:30.  I ended up joining a group going out to
dinner in an East London Indian Restaurant.  Jeremy Pickens was kind
enough to shepard the six of us through the tube and to the
restaurant.  The food was excellent, and plentiful (and extremely
inexpensive for London).
<br>

<br>
  And finally the day was capped off with a
Jazz/rap concert by Soweto Kinch in Spitalfields.
<img src="support_files/1_003.jpg">
</p><p> You don't hear music like that in New Hampshire.
</p><p>
All in all it was a great day. And now ... off to bed ...

                Hey Paul - regarding the searching of music in other 
languages, if lyrics are the traditional method of searching for 
content, can machine translation systems be used to pre-translate (or at
 least provide the gist of the lyric) at indexing-time ? Of course, 
since good MT is extremely domain-specific at the moment, I'd imagine 
you'd still need to combine these with other clues about the content : 
just a thought.

                Tim:
The problem is that when I listen to, say, indian music with lyrics, I 
have no idea what the lyrics are, I can't even come up with a phonetic 
version of them, so I have nothing to translate. I don't have an english
 version to offer to a translator, and I don't have the Indian version 
either.
