			<h2>Going where no collaborative filter can go</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Most music recommenders use some form of collaborative filtering to 
connect listeners with new music. That's not a surprise, CF works really
 well for popular music (which, of course, is what most people are 
listening to).  But if you are interesting in long tail music, music 
that is unpopular (or perhaps music that is brand new and doesn't have 
any listeners), then you are out of luck A collaborative filtering 
algorithm cannot help you -- CF recommenders rely on the wisdom of the 
crowds, but that leaves them impotent when there are no crowds.  One 
approach to the  problem of dealing with new (or unpopular) content is 
to use a content-based recommender - instead of making recommendations 
based upon who is listening to a song, the recommendations are made 
based on what the song sounds like. 
<p> We've seen a few commercial music recommenders that rely on 
content-based techniques - MusicIP, Echo Nest, Ghanni, One Llama, 
Audiobaba,  Owl,  SoundFlavor and Pandora have all had some aspect of 
content-based recommendation at the core of their systems.  Now there's 
another content-based recommender to add to the list of contenders - 
mufin. <a href="http://beta.mufin.com/"><img src="support_files/_mufin-logo.png" alt="mufin-logo.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" border="0" height="94" width="356"></a>
</p><p>
<a href="http://beta.mufin.com/">Mufin</a> (which stands for <b>Mu</b>sic<b>Fin</b>der) is a content-based recommender that (<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/08/mufin-an-automated-music-recommendation-engine-that-actually-works/">according to Techcrunch</a>) is an offshoot of Fraunhofer (the folks who invented the MP3). Given this pedigree, I had very high expectations for Mufin.
</p><p>
</p><h2> The Technology</h2>
From the<a href="http://business.mufin.com/uk/mufin/technology/"> Mufin Technology page</a>: 
<p>
</p><ul><i>mufin uses mathematical extraction of specific details from a
 music title to create an objective desciption of the titleâ€™s 
characteristics which is independent of human influences. Using this 
description, songs which are similar to one another can be filtered out 
of a large database.  Rhythmical characteristics (e.g. intensity of the 
rhythm, tempo, percussion in the piece), sound colour, harmonic and 
melodic qualities are weighted differently for the result.
</i>
</ul> 
<h2> My Impressions</h2>
I was lucky enough to get a invitation to the Mufin private beta - so I took it for a spin - here are my impressions.
<p>
<img src="support_files/_mufin-search.png" alt="mufin-search.png" border="0">
</p><p>
The Mufin site is very simple to understand.  It has a classic search 
box where you can search for an artist, album or track.  Since there are
 nearly 5,000,000 tracks in the catalog you are bound to find what you 
are looking for.  I searched for bands like Deerhoof, ELP, The Beatles, 
Hannah Montana, The Feelies, and the Rheostatics.  Mufin had them all.  
Unfortunately, Mufin won't let you play back all of the songs in the 
catalog - some songs can be played all the way through, some you can 
play 30 second excerpts, and some are not playable at all - this is, no 
doubt due to the crazy licensing issues that plague digital music.  
Mufin also lets you purchase tracks from iTunes - (allowing Mufin to 
make some money via referrals).
</p><p>
</p><h2> The Recommendations </h2>
Of course, searching for music is no big deal - what we are interested 
in are the content-based recommendations.   So lets check them out.
<p>
Whenever I try out a new content-based recommender, the first track I usually try is  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_9">Revolution #9 </a>by the Beatles. This is a good way to find out if a recommender is really <a href="ghanni_music.html">a CF recommender trying to pose as a content-based recommender</a>.
  Revolution 9 is so unlike any other Beatles song (or any other Rock or
 Pop song recorded in the 70s)  - that recommendations from a 
content-based recommender will yield very different results than what 
you'd get from a CF recommender.  Using Mufin to find music similar to 
Revolution #9 yielded a rather strange grab bag of music: Some Wagner, 
Engelbert Humperdink, UFO, Gershwin, The Disney Aladin Soundtrack, Frank
 Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald. No 70s pop, which is a good sign, but the
 results seemed to be strongly under the influence of a random number 
generator.  Not a very good start - but since Revolution #9 is not your 
typical track perhaps these results were an aberration.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_muf-rev9.png" alt="muf-rev9.png" border="0">
</p><p>
So I moved on to something a bit more conventional - some power pop with from Weezer. I tried the track 'My Name is Jonas'
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_mufin-weezer.png" alt="mufin-weezer.png" border="0">
</p><p>
These results looked better with tracks by Foreigner, Cell Division, 
Guano Apes, Dream Theater. However, there was also quite a bit of heavy 
metal - Rhapsody, Kamelot, Dio - that didn't really seem to fit to well.
</p><p>
Next up was some cool jazz - Take Five by Dave Brubeck. For similar 
tracks I did get some cool jazz like McCoy Tyner, but also some salsa, 
some crash test dummies, some blues by McCracklin and Louisiana Red 
(good stuff, but not anywhere near the cool jazz and syncopated rhythms 
of Brubeck), some female vocalist/country music by Frances Black, Gospel
 music by the Jackon Southernaires.  Again it seemed like the random 
number generator was working overtime on this set of recommendations.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_muf-takefive.png" alt="muf-takefive.png" border="0">
</p><p>
Next up was Led Zeppelins venerable classic Stairway to Heaven:
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_mufin-sw.png" alt="mufin-sw.png" border="0">
</p><p>
The recommendations included soul music by Aaron Neville, minimalist 
electronica (tubular bells), classical piano (Mussorgsky), easy 
listening (Englebert Humperdink, Paul Anka).  There was no need to 'get 
the led out' of this list.  One has to wonder about a recommender that 
puts Engelbert Humperdink in the same list as Mussorgsky's Pictures at 
an Exhibition.
</p><p>
Finally I tried some classical music - with Beethoven's Fifth symphony.
</p><p><img src="support_files/_muf-beet.png" alt="muf-beet.png" border="0">
</p><p>
These recommendations seem to be much better - the recommendations 
include some more Beethoven, there's Hayden, Handel, Tschaikovksy, 
Mozart, Chopin, Dvorak and a number of classical film scores.
</p><p>
</p><h2> Summmary</h2>
The Mufin folks have done a good job putting together the Mufin site.  
They've indexed an incredible amount of music. The search engine and the
 recommender engine are fast. The site design is clean, and easy to use.
 However, the content-based recommendations provided by Mufin don't fair
 well when compared to the type of recommendations one can get from a CF
 filtering recommender. There is a very high rate of 'clunker' tracks 
that no human would ever recommend based upon the seed track.  For some 
seed tracks, the recommendations seemed no better than shuffle play 
-while for others especially classical, the recommendations seemed to be
 pretty good.
<p> The Mufin team are <a href="http://blog.mufin.com/rollercoaster/2008/10/09/en/">working hard</a>
 to improve their recommendations - I hope they get the kinks out - it 
would be nice to see long tail, content-based recommendation become a 
reality.

<p>There are clear stylistic similarities between Beethoven and Haydn, 
but Handel, Tchaikovsky, Mozart, and Chopin represent *huge* misses for 
Mufin.  </p>


<p>Lumping these disparate composers together says little about the 
success (or failure) of Mufin, however it boldly proclaims your 
ignorance of non-popular music -- a common theme I find throughout the 
MIR community.  </p>


<p>And if we humans don't know what we're talkin' 'bout, how we gonna teach the machines?</p>

<p>@anonymous commenter - about  Beethoven, Hayden, Handel, 
Tschaikovksy, Mozart, Chopin, Dvorak - I wasn't saying these were great 
recommendations - my point was that at least this set of similar pieces 
were from the same top level genre (classical), which was better than 
all of the other sets of similar artists which would span across a 
number of top level genres.  </p>

<p>But is the way to evaluate these sorts of systems really to feed the 
algorithm only a single seed track?  I would say that there is so little
 information contained in a single track that it says more about the 
quantity of data than it does about the power of the recommender.</p>


<p>If I were building a content-based music recommendation engine, I 
would (1) crawl someone's 1000+ song collection, (2) filter out the more
 popular tunes, (3) run my content-based feature extraction algorithms 
and find common features across *all* the songs (not just one song), and
 then (4) use those features as the basis or input to the recommendation
 engine.</p>


<p>Because otherwise, it is unclear what you really mean when you say 
"find me something like this one".  The Engelbert Humperdink song might 
have the same phrase structure as the Mussorgsky piece (e.g. 
ABABCCAA'BB').  And unless you've specified otherwise, that is as good a
 match as any.</p>

<p>Not to beat a dead horse, but I do find this kind of naive misstatement to be an all-to-common occurrence within the community.</p>


<p>I come to MIR with an "upside down" resume -- 30+ years in academic 
music performance and conservatory study with only a decade or so of 
"self-taught" CS.  And nothing looks more ridiculous than a well formed 
process producing musically incoherent results that has dozens of MIR 
research engineers jumping for joy.  (I realize this is not the case 
here, but I've seen it happen plenty of times...)</p>


<p>The "secret ingredient" so often missing from these evaluations is an
 intimate awareness of the mechanics of musical language.  A true 
understanding of exactly how musical events can function and be 
interpreted in various contexts.</p>


<p>Put another way, relying on a 200-course-level music theory knowledge
 base to unravel the complexities involved in understanding music genre 
classification is about as clever as trying to determine the potential 
of neural network based approaches to machine learning with only a few 
months experience hacking around on cgi-perl scripts.</p>


<p>So when will the musical scholars show up to shed some light on this otherwise potentially fascinating subject?</p>

<p>@anonymous - your point is well taken. However, the state-of-the-art 
for automatic music similarity and classification is such that even 
simple tasks such as classifying music as 'classical' or 'not classical'
 (a task that an eight year old, without any music training can do 
easily) can be challenging for computers. I certainly agree that the MIR
 field will benefit from deep music theory knowledge, but I don't think 
it is necessary for every MIR task. </p>


<p>I'll stand by my "naive misstatement" - that Mufin's  playlist based 
on Beethoven's Fifth  is much better than the 'Stairway to Heaven' 
playlist.  I use the simplest evaluation metric - how many tracks in the
 top 5 are in the same high level genre of the seed track. For the 
Stairway list, I would expect similar tracks to be 'rock'  - the Mufin 
list has  3 'easy listening' tracks, 1 'minimalist / experimental' and 1
 'classical' - for a score of zero. For the Fifth symphony playlist, I'd
 expect 'classical' tracks in the similarity list. Mufin gives me 4 out 
of 5.  With this basic metric, the Beethoven list is better. I don't 
think one needs even music theory 101 to make that evaluation.</p>


<p>It is still early days for content-based music similarity. These 
systems make errors that no humans would make - they'll put Led Zeppelin
 and Englebert Humperdinck in the same bucket, likewise they'll put 
Beethoven and Chopin in the same bucket. I think it will be a long time 
before these systems are capable of recognizing musical nuances that 
someone with your music expertise is capable of recognizing.  </p>

<p>Apologies for posting anonymously, but we attend the same conferences
 and I've often found my views to be unwelcome in certain circles.  That
 said, I *very much* appreciate your having this conversation with me...</p>


<p>And so it appears I haven't made myself entirely clear.  My condensed
 point (as it applies to your original post) is this: while it may not 
ring true to an 8-year-old, there may well exist a great deal of musical
 similarity between Led Zeppelin and Englebert Humperdinck...</p>


<p>For example, the instrumental combinations found in both samples are 
drawn from an awfully short list of candidates.  Both are likely to 
contain a strong sense of similar (and easily detectable) metric 
regularity.  It's also very likely that the harmonic structure will be 
made up of very similar (possibly even the same, in instances like the 
"blues") diatonic/modal progressions.  </p>


<p>*None* of this is at all likely to be the case when comparing Handel to Brahms.</p>


<p>So if you're willing to assert that 100+ of years of evolutionary 
language development throughout numerous (and often disparate) ensemble 
configurations (solo, choral, chamber, orchestral, etc.) can be lumped 
into a single genre label, then you'd better accept the fact that 
"easy-listening" and "heavy metal" belong together as well.  </p>


<p>Throughout the MIR community, I see dozens of efforts attempting to 
organize popular music collections into record industry created genre 
terms like electronica, trance, synth-pop, and dub.  </p>


<p>It seems to me that getting beyond this simplistic view will require 
experienced investigation into the musical language of specific 
composers as well as the tendencies of performers.  Experience and 
awareness that is frequently (and mysteriously) lacking in these 
circles.</p>

<p>anonymous: Paul does have a point, but I'm also kinda on your side on
 this one.  There are more ways of organizing music information, and 
measuring similarity, than just genre.</p>


<p>For example, one information need that I've long had, ever since I 
started social dancing 15 years ago, is the need to find songs that have
 not only similar rhythmic structures, but also have the right harmonic 
structure and overall "feel", such that I can dance the same types of 
dance to those songs.</p>


<p>For example, suppose I want to do a cha-cha.  Typically, you would 
think of cha-chas as more some sort of latin genre.  But there are also 
songs by Madonna that are wonderful cha-chas.  And I know of at least 
one song by the post-punk/mod godfather Paul Weller that is a fun 
cha-cha.  They would not technically fall into the cha-cha genre, but 
they could very much be used to teach and to dance a cha-cha.</p>


<p>And so even though all these song are from different "genres" (who in
 their right mind would lump Latin with Madonna with post-punk?), they 
are all similar by means of some deeper, musical structure.  And by 
means of a specific user information need.</p>


<p>I really think that MIR needs more of this sort of processing, the 
deeper, musical knowledge processing.  And MIR really needs to think 
longer and harder about what information needs somebody really has.. 
what they're really after when looking for music.  </p>


<p>Because ultimately, what it comes down to is the information need.  
For some types of information need, Paul is completely correct with his 
approach.  The surface-timbral, social genres that one gets by throwing 
bag-of-features machine learning approaches at the content does solve a 
particular kind of information need.  The deeper rhythmic approach 
solves another, different need.  And so on.  Both of you are right -- 
and it really all comes down to the user.  </p>


<p>Believe it or not ISMIR was actually founded/started by musicologists
 and deeper music theorists.  I know.  I was there, back in 2000, 2001, 
2002.  I saw it.  </p>


<p>And in the early days, there was a lot more discussion around 
musicological approaches.  There have been papers on 
musicologically-inspired processing and similarity.  There have been 
papers on performance analysis.  In the last 3-4 years that part of the 
community has shrunk in size, while the social genre and bag-of-MFCC 
machine learners have grown in size.  That's ok.  The community is 
dynamic.  But the musicologists have not disappeared completely.  
They're still around.  You can find them, discuss with them.  And I 
would strongly encourage you to do so, and to do your best to 
publish/share/evangelicize your thoughts and results.  I know there are 
certain program committee members, from year to year, that share a 
desire for more of the musicological papers to be accepted, and their 
voice does hold some sway.  </p>

<p>You're right, the recs are quite bad.  Also you're right that Tubular
 Bells is a wack rec for Stairway to Heaven, but, Tubular Bells is *not*
 minimalist electronica.</p>

<p>@anonymous .. "but, Tubular Bells is *not* minimalist electronica."  -
 oh sure it is! I was relying on the expertise of none other than Ishkur
 himself.</p>


<p>To see for yourself go to <a href="http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/</a></p>


<p>Click on 'downtempo', and then click on 'minimalism' and Tubular Bells is the first example.</p>
