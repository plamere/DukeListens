				<p>Here's a screenshot of a recommendation made by Amazon's 
wonderful book recommender.&nbsp; This shows the classic collaborative 
filtering (CF) algorithm at work:&nbsp; "Customers who bought the <em>Da Vinci Code</em>
 also bought these items ... " It is a great way to get recommendations,
 but sometimes it can go awry.&nbsp; Here we see three recommendations. 
The first two recommendations seem quite reasonable: <em>Digital Fortress</em> is a book by the same author as the Da Vinci Code, <em>Holy Blood Holy Grail </em>is<em> </em>a book about the same subject matter as the Da Vinci code.&nbsp; The 3rd recommendation - the 5th <em>Harry Potter </em>book,
 seems rather strange.&nbsp; It is a book written for a completely 
different demographic - middle schoolers and young adults, it is a 
fantasy about school kids and has very little similarity to an art 
history thriller such as the Da Vinci Code.&nbsp; So what gives? Is the 
Amazon recommender broken?&nbsp; Nah ... it is doing it's job just 
fine.&nbsp; The Da Vinci Code and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
 do have one thing in common.&nbsp; They are both very popular books and
 they happened to be very popular at the same time.&nbsp; When mom would
 go to Amazon to order a copy of the Da Vinci Code, she would also pick 
up a copy of Harry Potter for the kids.&nbsp; This was repeated 
thousands of time, and the Amazon recommender duly noted the 
correlation.&nbsp;&nbsp; From a shopper's perspective, it is probably a 
pretty good recommendation.&nbsp; Amazon knows that if you buy this 
book, based on its data, there's a 5% chance that you'll pick up the 
latest Harry Potter as well.&nbsp; However, from a book reader's 
perspective, this is probably a poor recommendation, the books have 
little in common.&nbsp; </p><p>A recommender for shopping is not the 
same as a recommender for discovery.&nbsp; If you are shopping for 
books, Amazon is the place to go, but if you are looking for a good book
 to read, you may want to use a recommender like <a href="https://www.librarything.com/">LibraryThing</a> that recommends books based on who has read a book as opposed to who has purchased a book.<br></p><p><img src="support_files/pb.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="100%">&nbsp;</p>

                Thanks for the favorable mention of LibraryThing, but I 
want to press on the distinction between "shopper and "reader." 

Books are for reading as food is for eating. If I buy pasta, olive oil 
and pine nuts, suggesting basil is a good recommendation. Milk is not, 
no matter the raw statistical correlations involved. Statistical 
correlations are the start, not the end of a good recommendation system,
 even when all you care about is the commercial side.

When it comes to books--and I'm speaking with a lot of experience--raw 
statistical correlations give you Harry Potter almost every time. Around
 LibraryThing we call that the "Harry Potter problem." Have Nabokov's 
_Pale Fire_? What are you most likely to have as well? _Ada_? _Lolita_? 
No, Harry Potter. I'm surprised their recommendations for bananas--yes, 
Amazon now sells bananas--aren't Harry Potter books too.

LibraryThing's system is, as you write, based on who reads what, not who
 buys what. But I don't think that accounts for most of the difference. 
Fundamntally, we tune the algorithm toward interestingness, not 
obviousness. 

LibraryThing wants to entertain, certainly, but we're also selling our 
data now. We want the data to "work." I think that, even in a purely 
commercial context, interesting wins out. For example, Harry Potter on 
Amazon almost always recommends the *other* five Harry Potters. The 
simple statistical overlap between purchase histories is undeniable. But
 even if, as I suspect, they've done A/B tests on what actually gets 
clicked, it probably makes sense. 

This is the logic of the online ad. What clicks works. But Amazon 
recommendations are not Adsense links. They're editorial content too. To
 measure them properly you need to look at the whole buying pattern. If 
Harry Potter recommends Philip Pullman books, my click through might be 
lower, but I'll probably buy the next Harry Potter anyway, and now 
you've hooked me on another series. That is, there are surely secondary 
effects, even if they're hard to track. (Speaking of series, don't get 
me started on "backward" recommendations--enjoyed Book 6, how about 
reading 5?) And recommending Philip Pullman or, say, Susan Cooper keeps 
me interested, keeps me from thinking of the links as "just" ads. Keeps 
me from becoming "recommendation blind," as I have become ad blind.

In my opinion, the interestingness of Amazon recommendations has been 
eroding for a while now. I certainly look at them less. I don't envy 
them here. Calculating long-term effects is difficult if not impossible 
to measure, particularly compared to a straight A/B test. But there must
 be an effect. 

Ultimately, recommendations are like any other long-term content that 
can be manipulated for short-term gains at the expense of long-term 
value. You can get a ratings bump if your sitcom characters ski-jump 
sharks and have babies. But it erodes the franchise. In the end, people 
turn away.
