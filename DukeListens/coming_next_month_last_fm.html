			<h2>Coming next month: Last.fm's biggest challenge</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				There's an interesting story in the Washington Post about CBS's plans for Last.fm. 
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/17/AR2008041703719.html"><em>CBS Interactive's Quincy Smith On Re-Org: 'More CBS Corp. Firepower Focused On Interactive' - washingtonpost.com</em></a><em>:
 "Last.fm: It's almost a year since CBS plunked down $280 million for 
the UK music recommendation start-up and Smith knows he needs to deliver
 on all that promise. Last.fm has been growing rapidly on its own and 
has been given start-up like breathing room but it's time to bring it 
more into the fold. As we've written here before, Last.fm also needs 
more U.S. traction. Yes, Smith said, they bought Last.fm in part because
 of its strong international appeal. 'But it's our job, frankly, as a 
corporation, to make them more valid in the United States.' To that end,
 CBS will ramp up on-air promos with 'a lot more call outs' starting in 
May and, very soon, Last.fm will get its own CMO 'charged with plugging 
them more into the CBS mainstream.' In late May, CBS will start sending 
viewers of certain shows to the show's music on Last.fm. 'The downside 
of Last.fm right now, from my perspective, has nothing to do with the 
service itself ... the question is how do you blow it up and make it a 
major media brand in the United State?' Last.fm is working with CBS 
Interactive's Entertainment unit. As Smith put it, 'CBS has done much 
less of a job with Last.fm than Last.fm has done with Last.fm.'"</em></p><em></em>
No doubt going mainstream with Last.fm is necessary for CBS to justify 
their $280 million dollar investment - but for a site like Last.fm, 
going mainstream is really tricky.  Last.fm listeners tend to be highly 
engaged music fans - whose taste runs to less mainstream music - you are
 more apt to find artists like Radiohead, Arcade Fire and the Postal 
Service in the top ten at Last.fm compared to the mainstream pop artists
 like Mariah Carey and Miley Cyrus that populate the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&amp;f=Pop+100">Billboard Pop 100</a>.
  As Last.fm goes mainstream, there is going to be a culture clash as 
the mainstream listeners collide with the old-school last.fm listeners. 
 Teenyboppers (and their angry parents) will wonder why <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Hannah+Montana/+tags">Hannah Montana is tagged</a>
 with 'hardcore death metal' and 'lesbian'. Old-school last.fm listeners
 will leave for alternative sites as last.fm loses its focus as the best
 site to discover new indie and alternative music.   It's Digg all over 
again. As<a href="https://mashable.com/2008/02/05/digg-tech-section-analysis/"> Digg went mainstream</a>,
 it lost its focus on technology - and all the hard-core tech readers 
went back to slashdot.  The problem for Last.fm is that as it goes 
mainstream, it risks losing much of its core audience - the highly 
engaged music fan - and this user base of hard core music fans is one of
 Last.fm's biggest asset.

<p>Interesting analysis Paul. But I'd disagree on the comparison to 
Digg. Digg has a single frontpage. Last.fm has millions of frontpages 
(artist pages, user pages, ...). Various communities already co-exist on
 Last.fm which might not even have Radiohead in common. </p>


<p>Regarding tag abuse: we're working on it. One solution to the problem
 would be to attract more fans of the respective artists which would 
help our algorithms decide which tags are offensive and which ones 
aren't. So going mainstream is actually one of the solutions to the 
problem.</p>


<p>Overall, opening up Last.fm to casual listeners will also improve the user experience also for our "hard core music fans" :-)</p>

<p>I think it's worse than that because when the newbies flood the site,
 the fact that Last.fm has not supported the community-building social 
connections as well as it's supported the music discovery side of things
 will mean that those old users may not have developed enough strong 
ties to other users to keep them there even if they no longer like the 
whole -- especially if the strong ties they did form with those users 
are also being sustained elsewhere on the net and off (I've got data on 
that -- they are). </p>
