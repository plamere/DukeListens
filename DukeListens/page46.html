Silicon Valley has always been the hot bed of new startups.&nbsp; 
There's something about the area south of San Francisco, with its 
Venture Capitalists, Stanford and perpetual good weather.&nbsp; Apple, 
HP, Sun, Google and Yahoo all started there years ago.<br><br>Anyone 
who's been paying attention to the music discovery space realizes that 
there's a whole new generation of 'music 2.0' companies out there. These
 are companies that are building systems to help you explore and 
download music.&nbsp; Of course, leading the field is Silicon Valley's 
Apple, with its iTunes and iPod.&nbsp; But, surprisingly, they are one 
of the few Music 2.0 companies that is based in Silicon 
Valley.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've&nbsp; made a list of the first 20 or so music 
2.0 companies that I could think of along with their locations.&nbsp; As
 you can see Silicon Valley is under-represented.&nbsp; So, even though 
Silicon Valley may be the center of the world for Web 2.0, it certainly 
is not the center of the Music 2.0 world.&nbsp; <br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

 up your metadata - it will perform some basic text analysis to look for

inconsistent genre info, missing audio and such.</li><li>Detect 
BPM&nbsp; - beaTunes can analyze your (Non-DRMd) music to find the 
beats-per-minute for each song and add the info to your iTunes music 
database, (iTunes already supports a BPM field, it just doesn't know how
 to populate it)</li><li>Generate similar playlists - beaTunes will

			<h3><a href="ilike_beta_launch.html" title="permalink">iLike beta launch - a review</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				
Last night at 10pm, <a href="http://ilike.com/" target="_self">iLike</a> launched their beta. iLike is a social music discovery service funded by Sun founder Vinod Khosla.&nbsp; <br><br>iLike, like other social music sites such as <a href="https://last.fm/" target="_self">last.fm</a>
 has a substantial web presence as well as an iTunes plugin.&nbsp; The 
iTunes plugin runs as an iTunes 'drawer' a sidebar that adds iLike 
context information such as information about 'related artists' as well 
as info about your iLike 'friends'<br><br><img src="support_files/tour1.jpg"><br><br>When
 you play songs in itunes, info shows up in the iLike sidebar.&nbsp; For
 instance, if the 'Related' artist tab is selected, when you play a song
 by Death Cab for Cutie, you'll see songs by artists such as the Postal 
Service, ColdPlay and The Shins in the 'related artists' tab.<br><br>I 
found the 'related artists' to be more than a bit disappointing.&nbsp; 
To me, the purpose of a 'related artists' recommender is to help me find
 music that I don't know about that is similar to what I'm listening to 
now.&nbsp; The iLike 'related artists' falls short in a few ways.&nbsp; 
First, the recommendations are artist related, not song related, so no 
matter what song I play by an artist I'm given the same 
recommendations.&nbsp; If I play the Beatles 'Helter Skelter' or 
'Michele' - I get the same recommendations although they are very 
different songs.&nbsp; Second, the recommendations for the most part 
were completely obvious.&nbsp; I like it best when a recommender gives 
me some recommendations from artists that I've not heard of before, but 
the iLike recommendations were (with some notable exception - see 
below), were so predictable it was as if they were scraped from the <a href="http://allmusic.com/" target="_self">All Music Guide</a> related artists.&nbsp; <br>Here's a set of recommendations received.<br><br><table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">Seed Artist</span> <br></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recommendation</span> <br></td>
</tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Led Zeppelin<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Pink Floyd, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, AC/DC, Black Sabbath<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Beatles<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Pink Floyd, Radiohead, U2, The Rolling Stones<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Weezer<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Green Day, Foo Fighters, Jimmy Eat World, Nirvana, The Beatles<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Johnny Cash<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Willie Nelson, Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings, Hank Williams, Merle Haggard<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Fiona Apple<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan, Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Norah Jones<br></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">Yes<br></td><td style="vertical-align: top;">Rush, Genesis, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Kansas</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>I did get a clunker recommendation however.&nbsp; When I was playing
 Emerson, Lake and Palmer's Karn Evil 9 - a progressive rock masterpiece
 -&nbsp; I was given the recommendation 'Grandma Got Run over by a 
reindeer' by Elmo &amp; Patsy, as well as 4 other christmas songs.&nbsp;
 Clearly outside the realm of a reasonable recommendation.&nbsp; iLike 
promises that their recommendations will get better as they get more 
users. That's the classic social recommender cold-start problem - you 
need lots of users to get good recommendations, but in early days, 
before you have lots of users, you'll generate crappy recommendations. 
I'm sure their recommendations will get better - and I hope that 
eventually they can tell me things that I don't already know - maybe a 
NiN recommendation for that Johnny Cash fan once in a while.<br><br>iLike&nbsp;
 also offers a set of 'free music by new artists' in the 'related' 
panel.&nbsp; I found the music to interesting, but generally not very 
well related to the seed artist. Again, probably a symptom of the 
cold-start problem.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it is a good source of free 
indie music - I downloaded the song 'Sad Reminders' by 'the Winter 
Sounds' - funny thing was that iLike couldn't find any related music to 
this song - iLike recommended this song since it was related to some 
Pink Floyd that I was listening to, but when I was listening to the 
song, iLike didn't seem to know anything about it.<br><br>If you go to 
your iLike home page on the web, iLike will give you another more 
detailed set of music recommendations.&nbsp; This, for me, was a mix of 
free mp3s as well as songs I could buy at iTunes.&nbsp; The top 
recommendation was ... you guessed it ... 'Grandma got run over by a 
reindeer'.&nbsp; It would be nice if iLike could tell me why they are 
recommending a particular song (much like Amazon or Pandora do).&nbsp; 
Words like "We are recommending 'Grandma got run over by a reindeer' 
because you like annoyingly-cute christmas songs'."&nbsp; Or .. "We are 
recommending 'Grandma got run over by a reindeer' because it is similar 
to Emerson Lake and Palmer's opus about nuclear armageddon." would be 
helpful.<br><br>iLike uploads your iTunes play history to the iLife 
server, and makes this visible to all.&nbsp; If you are a privacy 
fanatic (or even just slightly concerned about privacy), this may be a 
bit disconcerting.&nbsp; For instance, you can look at my music play 
history here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ilike.com/user/Paul_L2" target="_self">http://www.ilike.com/user/Paul_L2</a>.&nbsp; I took a quick browse through the <a href="http://www.ilike.com/user" target="_self">iLike users</a> - its a who's who of music discovery - there's Tom, CTO of Pandora, a whole gaggle of the last.fm crew, Toby from musicmobs, <a href="http://netblogsrocknroll.com/" target="_self">Mr. DJ Alchemi</a>
 and others. (BTW, Does DJ really want us to know that his #2 song of 
all time is "Can't get you out of my head " by Kylie Minogue?)<br><br>Probably
 the neatest thing that iLike has to offer is the ability to browse 
through other people's music history - this harkens back to the day of 
the original napster - where you could browse through the music 
collections of thousands of people.&nbsp; Of course, the difference is 
that unlike napster, when you are browsing you can listen to 30 second 
low quality clip, but you can't download the song without forking over 
$.99 to iTunes.&nbsp; iLike does have a neat compatibility score. When 
you are browsing through another listener's collection - you are shown a
 score that shows how well matched your music collections are.&nbsp; 
iLike touts this ability to browse through other people's collections as
 one of their key differentiators - but last.fm has been doing this for 
quite some time - here's my listening history on last.fm:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.last.fm/users/lamere" target="_self">http://www.last.fm/users/lamere</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Growing Pains - </span>iLike
 is a beta and as such there were a few snags here and there.&nbsp; When
 I first installed iLike, the sidebar drawer was all scrambled. It 
looked like all of the tabbed panels in the sidebar were visible at the 
same time.&nbsp; A restart of iTunes seemed to fix that.&nbsp; Another 
glitch - if I'm listening to a song in iTunes, and then click on a song 
in someone's collection to preview it, the iTunes song doesn't stop 
playing - so I end up hearing two songs at the same time.&nbsp; Hey, but
 this is a beta, so I'm sure these things will be fixed in no time.<br><br>So here's a rundown of what iLike does:<br><ul><li>Adds an iTunes plugin that uploads your play history</li><li>Gives somewhat obvious related artist recommendations</li><li>Offers a set of song recommendations<br></li><li>Lets you find other users like yourself</li><li>Lets you browse the music collections of others</li><li>Give you recommendations for 'related' free-to-download music</li></ul>I
 think iLike has done well on execution. The web site and the plugin are
 quite slick - and eye-friendly - but so far, I haven't seen them do 
anything that isn't already being done by other social sites such as <a href="https://last.fm/" target="_self">last.fm</a>.&nbsp;
 They don't do social tagging. They don't do playlist generation.&nbsp; 
They don't offer music charts.&nbsp; They don't expose any of their data
 with a web services API.&nbsp; You can only listen to 30 second music 
clips. Like <a href="http://qloud.com/" target="_self">QLoud,</a> they 
are suffering from the cold-start problem - until they get a large 
enough user base they'll continue to recommend 'Grandma got run over by a
 reindeer' to progressive rock fans.&nbsp; Like QLoud, I don't think 
excellent execution is going to let them catch up to last.fm - with its 
deep set of social data.&nbsp; Still, it is just a beta, iLike has good 
funding, an it looks like they have an&nbsp; excellent technical and 
management team, so I'm sure iLike will be doing some interesting, 
innovative things in the music discovery space soon. They certainly bear
 watching.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Update - I <span style="font-weight: bold;">am</span> having fun with iLike - browsing through other people's music tastes is interesting and somewhat addictive.</span><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<br><br><img style="float: right;"  ="" src="support_files/celestialjukebox.jpg">One
 of the key enabling technologies for the ecosystem that will ultimately
 become the celestial jukebox is a universally used, free, Song ID 
system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Song ID system unambiguously assigns an an 
ID, (much like a UPC product code), to each unique audio 
recording.&nbsp; The ideal SongID will be able to distinguish between 
various performances and remixes of a song, while still recognizing that
 different encodings and equalizations of a song are still the same 
song.&nbsp;&nbsp; A universally used songID will allow&nbsp; various 
music tools and services to work together.&nbsp; People will be able to 
easily share playlists, recommenders will be able to refer listeners to 
tracks in any music service provider collection.&nbsp; It will be easy 
to find the metadata (album art, reviews, bibliographic info, lyrics) 
for a song.<br><br>There's no shortage of commercial songID 
system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that they all cost money, and they 
tie you to a particular vendor's silo (songID, metadata, 
recommender).&nbsp;&nbsp; No one vendor's songID has enough traction to 
become the universal songID.&nbsp; <br><br><img src="./support_files/MusicDNSorg.png"><br>The one system that has the best shot at becoming the universal songID system is the <a href="http://musicdns.org/" target="_self">MusicDNS</a> system.&nbsp; The MusicDNS system was created by&nbsp; the folks at <a href="http://musicip.com/" target="_self">MusicIP.</a>&nbsp;
 With the MusicDNS system, you use their open-source fingerprinter to 
get a fingerprint of audio. This fingerprint is sent to MusicDNS that 
(much like the Internet DNS), will resolve the fingerprint into a songID
 <span style="font-style: italic;">(update - and some a bit of metadata including track and artist name) </span>that
 can then be used to retrieve metadata associated with the music from 
metadata sources such as&nbsp; MusicBrainz (a wikipedia-like source of 
music metadata).<br><img src="support_files/MetaBrainz_logo.png"><br><br>I
 like the MusicDNS system because they have open-sourced the client and 
have worked very closely with MusicBrainz to make sure that the system 
will be available no matter what happens to MusicIP.&nbsp; (Spend a few 
minutes talking to Robert Kaye, the founder of MusicBrainz, and you'll 
hear nothing but good things about MusicIP and MusicDNS).<br><br>The 
MusicDNS system has always been free to use for non-commercial use, but 
if you were a commerical entity you had to negotiate a deal, and it was 
hard to predict what the final costs would be.&nbsp; (They would charge 
based on the number of songID lookups).&nbsp; <br><br>MusicDNS has just <a href="http://musicdns.org/licensing.jsp" target="_self">restructured</a> how it charges for use.&nbsp; A non-commercial license still is free for 5 million lookups per month. <span style="font-style: italic;">(Update -&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">commercial</span> access of up to 5 million requests per month is also free)&nbsp;</span>
 But now with the restructuring a commercial license costs $250 per year
 for up to 100 million lookups per month!&nbsp; That is so incredibly 
cheap that it should be a no-brainer even for the smallest web 2.0&nbsp;
 music startup.&nbsp; In fact it is so cheap that I doubt if it even 
covers the costs of running the MusicDNS lookup servers.<br><br>MusicDNS is doing all of the right things. They are <a href="https://blog.musicbrainz.org/archives/2006/03/new_fingerprint.html" target="_self">supporting MusicBrainz</a>,
 an excellent source for music metadata.&nbsp; They have opensourced the
 fingerprinting client. They have made the cost to use the system cheap 
enough so that anyone can use it . &nbsp; I really hope each and every 
one of those new music discovery companies (you all know who you are) 
will just start using this system.&nbsp; If we are all using this 
system, we can interoperate, we can trade playlists, we will all be 
steering our metadata updates to MusicBrainz, so our metadata will get 
better.&nbsp; The music ecosystem will be a better place.&nbsp; <br><br>

Last week, I configured things so I could blog directly from 
docs.google.com.  This week, I configured flickr so I can blog to 
blogs.sun.com using Flickr's  'blog this photo' .  Again the setup was 
very easy, and unlike the google posts, the flickr posts seem to have 
the proper timestamp. <br>
<br>
Ah yes, and this is my favorite rock concert photo. It captures all that
 is Weezer.  The untucked collared shirt, the sweater, the deferrential 
bow, with the rock salutes from the crowd. Nerd rock at its finest.

Sure, there was that Sonic Youth song called New Hampshire ... but, well, it wasn't really a good song now was it.   <br>
<br>
If you are looking for some other 'state' songs check out <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/services/the_current/features/2005/07/20050704_fifty_songs.php" target="_self">150 songs for 50 states</a>.
 And by the way, It is such a beautiful time of year in New Hampshire, 
you come and visit, see your sisters, hit your brother and hold your 
mother.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				There's a <a href="http://www.qloud.com/tutorial/iTunes/tutorial.html" target="_self">nifty flash demo</a>
 showing how the iTunes/qloud plugin supports tagging of songs. It is 
quite nice how the QLoud tagger is integrated directly into 
iTunes.&nbsp; You can easily tag your songs, and then use those tags to 
generate good playlists.&nbsp; The tags that you use to organize your 
local collection are also sent back to the qloud where they are 
aggregated and used to assist music discovery.&nbsp; Funny thing, 
though, in the tagging example they show a user getting songs that are 
tagged with 'love' to get a set of romantic songs.&nbsp; However, 
tagging is a somewhat fickle process.&nbsp; The user may get romantic 
songs, but the user may also get songs that were tagged 'love' because 
the tagger <span style="font-style: italic;">loved</span> the song, not 
because it was a perfect first-date song. So mixed in with the 
heart-melters, may be a face-melter.&nbsp; With the result that your 
romantic candelight dinner may be interrupted by the wails of Eddie Van 
Halen.<br><br>That good-looking <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/searchguy" target="_self">Search Guy,</a>
 Steve Green, will tell you that these social tagging systems just need 
to get a little smarter.&nbsp; With a little clustering-goodness, a 
tagging system such as Qloud should be able to notice that there are two
 types of 'love'-tagged songs: those associated with romance, and those 
associated with user-preference and if you build a playlist using an 
ambiguous tag, a less ambiguous tag (such as 'romantic' or 'favorite') 
is suggested.&nbsp; <br><br><img src="support_files/flickr_logo_gamma.gif">Flickr is starting to do this.&nbsp; You can explore the clusters associated with a tag.&nbsp; For instance&nbsp; <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/apple/clusters/" target="_self">Explore / Tags / apple / clusters</a>
 will show the clusters associated with the word 'apple'.&nbsp; There 
are four main 'apple' clusters:&nbsp; Pictures of macIntosh computers, 
pictures of the fruit, screenshots of OS X, and pictures of New York 
City (including one 'double-apple' showing a picture of the new Apple 
store in Manhattan).<br><br>Music discovery systems such as last.fm and 
qloud need to start doing the same thing - cluster the tags and help us 
dis-ambiguate the tags - this will give us more understandable results 
when we start to use the tags for generating playlists. <br><br><br>

				One of the MIREX <strike>competitions</strike> tasks this year was<a href="http://www.music-ir.org/mirex2006/index.php/Audio_Cover_Song_Identification_Results" target="_self"> Cover Song Identification</a>.&nbsp;
The goal was to find covers of a seed song within a much larger music
collection.&nbsp; The task was folded into the audio music similarity
task, so groups that submitted similarity systems also participated in
the cover song collection.&nbsp; Interestingly, but perhaps
unsurprisingly, systems that were developed specifically for cover song
detection performed much better than general audio similarity systems. <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/%7Edpwe/" target="_self">Dan Ellis</a>'s submission performed quite well.<br>
<br>
Of course, finding a cover song is not the same as finding a <span style="font-weight: bold;">good</span> cover song.&nbsp; A while back the Telegraph compiled a list of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/11/20/bmcovercont20.xml&amp;page=1" target="_self">top 50 covers ever</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their pick for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/11/20/bmcovercont20.xml&amp;page=11" target="_self">number 1 cover</a> is no surprise.<br>

			<h3><a href="javascript_memory_leaks_and_ie.html" title="permalink">Javascript, Memory Leaks and IE</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				
Recently, I wrote a web 2.0 style mashup.&nbsp; When I deployed, it 
worked great, except that some users would see browser crashes after a 
while.&nbsp; Looking closer, it looked like there was a memory leak, my 
web app was using up browser memory and not releasing it.&nbsp; Now, I'm
 not a bad coder, and it usually takes a pretty basic flaw to have a 
memory leak in a garbage-collected language like javascript.&nbsp; 
Scanning my code, showed no obvious errors.&nbsp; All my generated 
javascript objects were neatly discarded. I wasn't accidentally adding 
things to the DOM, where they could hang out for ever. I had no ever 
growing lists or tables that would keep references to objects to they 
wouldn't be GC'd.<br><br>But I did have a problem:&nbsp; A circular 
reference.&nbsp;&nbsp; IE has a very basic flaw in its garbage 
collector. It uses reference counting, and if there's a circular 
reference, the collector can't collect the objects.&nbsp; If object A 
points to object B and B (directly or indirectly) points to A, A and B 
can never be GC'd.&nbsp; <br><br>One of the Javascript idioms is to use 
function closures as callbacks. The closures give the callback access to
 the locally scoped variables where the function closure was 
declared.&nbsp; However, this closure forms a circular reference, and 
without special care, will cause a memory leak on IE.&nbsp; Every time a
 callback is added to an object (an image.onload for example), a 
circular reference is created.&nbsp; If the object involved happens to 
be something large like an image (as it was in my case), the leak can 
become pretty obvious pretty quickly.&nbsp; It is easy to break the 
circular reference (by removing the callback from the object when the 
callback is invoked), but of course, if you don't know about this 
problem, there's no reason to do it.<br><br>The Javascript closure idiom
 is pervasive in the web 2.0 world.&nbsp; I wonder how many web apps out
 there have memory leaks when running on IE due to IEs flaw in its 
garbage collector.&nbsp; There's a more detailed description of this 
problem on Jiberings page on <a href="http://www.jibbering.com/faq/faq_notes/closures.html" target="_self">Javascript closures.</a>&nbsp; (or you can look at the other million or so pages on this topic: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=javascript+ie+memory+leak+closure&amp;btnG=Search" target="_self">google javascript ie memory leak closure.)</a><br><br><br>

One of the really interesting features of Netbeans 6.0 is 'semantic

colors/highlights code based upon higher level information.&nbsp; For

about his week in Victoria at ISMIR 2006.&nbsp; A good read with lots

working on very similar things - both Elias and I are interested in
music similarity, visualizations and user interfaces for exploring
large music collections. &nbsp; Elias was showing MusicRainbow at ISMIR
this year - Elias confessed that he built the interface in the weeks
before ISMIR. Still it was a great looking tool - it seemed to have the
