			<h2>Foosic - the living music database</h2>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://www.foosic.org/index.php"><img src="support_files/foosic_header_logo.html" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a><a href="http://www.foosic.org/index.php">Foosic</a> is a barebones <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/">Audioscrobbler</a>
 clone - it is an aggregator for song plays.&nbsp; Foosic provides a 
plugin for a (small) number of players that will send your play history 
back to foosic where they collect this data in a database.&nbsp; Using 
this data, foosic offers charts on popular songs, artists, songs and 
genres and active users.&nbsp; They don't offer any sort of 
recommendations, they don't try to match you up with similar users, they
 don't offer to sell you concert tickets for your favorite bands - all 
foosic does is collect the playing history for lots of people and show 
some very basic charts.</p><p>In some ways, I like the singularity of 
purpose of foosic - going to one of the leading Music 2.0 sites such as 
last.fm, iLike or qloud - is like going to Yahoo - there are twenty 
things on the home page, all shouting for your attention - going to 
foosic is like going to Google - the page is clean - nothing is shouting
 at you - the things you can do on the site are few and obvious. </p><p>Still,
 for a song play aggregator such as foosic, there has to be a compelling
 reason for people to want to go to the trouble of downloading and 
installing a plugin - I can't see any value a foosic contributor gets 
from foosic beyond seeing summary stats for their listening habits 
(which iTunes can duplicate pretty well), or knowing that they are 
contributing to a larger stats pool.&nbsp; Perhaps foosic will add 
features in the future that will give me a reason for wanting to install
 the plugin.</p><p>Like most companies in this space,&nbsp; foosic faces
 the problem of bad metadata.&nbsp; Songs are mislabeled or missing, 
artists are misspelled - genres are inconsistent.&nbsp; To deal with 
this problem foosic has chosen to develop their own audio fingerprinting
 system - so they can unambiguously identify a track and assign it clean
 metadata.&nbsp; I find it puzzling that they've decided to create their
 own system when the MusicDNS / MusicBrainz system solves their problem 
so handily. Foosic would have a much better chance of cleaning up their 
data with the MusicDNS system - they could resolve each track to a 
MusicBrainz ID and retrieve good clean metadata via the MusicBrainz 
api.&nbsp; Right now, foosic has 6 different spellings for 'Emerson, 
Lake and Palmer' and a dozen or so spellings of 'The Beatles'. </p><p>Despite
 its somewhat low profile, foosic has collected quite a bit of data in 
its first 9 months of operation. It has nearly 4,000 users, nearly 6 
million submissions and data on 1.5 million tracks.&nbsp; According to 
its submission statistics page, foosic is averaging about 9 submissions a
 minute.&nbsp; This is pretty valuable data and foosic will likely be 
able to some interesting things with it.&nbsp; Foosic may have some 
scaling issues though - it takes 20 seconds to bring up the Top Songs 
page. 20 seconds is an eternity on the web.<br></p><p>Foosic isn't the first song play aggregator - <a href="https://last.fm/">Audioscrobbler/last.fm</a> has a 5 year head start, <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/music">Google Music trends</a>
 has a brand name that will attract users - so I have to wonder what 
foosic is going to do to distinguish itself from these other services. 
&nbsp; It is still early days for foosic - I'm interested in seeing 
where it goes.<br></p><p><br></p>
