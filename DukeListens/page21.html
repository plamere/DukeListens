 Stephen Johnson.&nbsp; This is the story how John Snow&nbsp; convinced 
the London health authorities that the Cholera epidemic was not caused 
by bad air (miasma), but was caused by contaminated drinking 
water.&nbsp;&nbsp; Johnson does an excellent job describing what life 
was like in London during the middle of the 19th century.&nbsp; Imagine a
 city of 2 million with no sewers - in fact much human waste would end 
up in the cellars of the poorer housing (and from the cellars, the waste
 could make its way to the public well.)&nbsp; </span>There was a 
scavenger class of night soil men, toshers, shoremen, pure collectors 
and others that made their living dealing with waste.&nbsp; Despite the 
fact that Londoner's were surrounded by all of waste, it was not obvious
 that this was related to the spread of disease.&nbsp; John Snow was 
convinced that all of this waste was polluting the drinking water.&nbsp;
 His challenge was to collect enough evidence in order to convince the 
establishment that this was the case.&nbsp; Snow used his familiarity 
with the Broad Street neighborhood, plenty of shoeleather,&nbsp; and 
(eventually) visualizations (the ghost map) to make his case, and the 
authorities removed the handle from the Broad Street pump.&nbsp; All in 
all,&nbsp; a good read, highly recommended.<br> </p><p>The book has a <a href="http://www.theghostmap.com/">website</a> with a number of good resources including a high resolution copy of the <a href="http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/snow/snowmap1.pdf">ghost map</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

			<h3><a href="an_apml_experiment.html" title="permalink">An APML Experiment</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><br>Lately there's been quite a bit of attention being paid to 
making sure that the data that describes the things that we like,&nbsp; 
our attention data, is portable.&nbsp; With portable attention data, we 
could go to any music store and be directed to the music that we are 
most likely to want to listen to.&nbsp; We won't have to spend any time 
rating tracks or artists, we'll just show the music store our taste 
data.&nbsp; Of course, this taste data needs to be in some standard 
format so that everyone can understand it. One effort at standardizing 
our taste data is APML.&nbsp; <a href="http://apml.org/">APML</a> is an 
XML based language that allows users to share their own personal taste 
data in much the same way that OPML allows the exchange of 
				reading lists between blog readers.&nbsp;&nbsp; APML is new and not 
finished yet, but even in its infant state, it is garnering lots of 
support.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>I am particularly interested in how APML 
could be used to represent an individual's music taste.&nbsp;&nbsp; One 
possibility is to have the APML file for the individual list the artists
 that a person likes (or vehemently dislikes).&nbsp; Another approach is
 to have the preferences be more abstract - to list weighted affinities 
toward music genres or styles.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter approach seemed 
much more interesting to me - it offers some bit of privacy (instead of 
seeing Paris Hilton in my APML file, you would just see&nbsp; Female Pop
 Singer).&nbsp; </p><p>As an experiment, I've created a little APML 
generator web service for last.fm users.&nbsp; If you give the web 
service your last.fm user name, the service goes to last.fm, retrieves 
data about your listening habits and generates an APML representation of
 your taste.&nbsp; For example, to retrieve the APML for my listening 
tastes visit the following URL:<br><br><a href="http://research.sun.com:8080/AttentionProfile/apml/music/lamere">http://research.sun.com:8080/AttentionProfile/apml/music/lamere</a><br><br><br>This yields:<br></p><pre>&lt;APML version="0.6"&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;Head&gt;<br>  &lt;Title&gt;music taste for lamere&lt;/Title&gt;<br>  &lt;Generator&gt;Created by TasteBroker.org in 2777 ms &lt;/Generator&gt;<br>  &lt;DateCreated&gt;2007-11-21T16:15:24&lt;/DateCreated&gt; <br>&lt;/Head&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;Body defaultprofile="music"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;Profile name="music"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;ImplicitData&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Concepts&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Concept key="rock" value="1.0" from="tastebroker.org" updated="2007-11-21T16:15:24"/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Concept key="alternative" value="0.74616855" from="tastebroker.org" updated="2007-11-21T16:15:24"/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Concept key="indie" value="0.63257456" from="tastebroker.org" updated="2007-11-21T16:15:24"/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Concept key="alternative rock" value="0.38583755" from="tastebroker.org" updated="2007-11-21T16:15:24"/&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;   &lt;!-- many lines omitted --&gt;<br>&nbsp;  &lt;/Concepts&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;/ImplicitData&gt;<br> &lt;/Profile&gt;<br>&lt;/Body&gt;<br><br>&lt;/APML&gt;<br></pre><p>To
 generate the implicit concepts, I gather the top 50 artists for the 
user, and for each of these artists I gather the top 50 tags that have 
been applied to each of those artists.&nbsp; I adjust the weight of the 
tags based on the user's affinity for the associated artist. I then take
 top scores to generate the APML. Of course, all this chattering with 
last.fm can make the web service quite slow.&nbsp; I do try to cache as 
much data as I can to try to speed things up, but if you have eclectic 
tastes, it can take up to a minute or so to generate your APML file.<br><br>The
 resulting APML seems to be a good representation of my taste.&nbsp; I'm
 interested in hearing from others that might be last.fm users whether 
or not the generated APML file is a good map of their taste.&nbsp; Feel 
free to try out the web service.&nbsp; The URL is:</p>http://research.sun.com:8080/AttentionProfile/apml/music/YOUR_LAST_FM_USER_NAME<p> The next step is to see how well we can generate recommendations based upon these APML files.<br><br>

				Toby Padilla, the creator of <a href="http://musicmobs.com/">Musicmobs</a>, one of the first social music sites has <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2007/11/20/toby-from-musicmobs-joins-lastfm">joined the last.fm team</a>.&nbsp;
 Musicmobs was clearly ahead of the curve - pioneering many aspects that
 are now seen as requirements in the 'Music 2.0' space. Social 
playlisting, recommendation, open web services,&nbsp; implicit gathering
 of taste data, - the 'hipster &lt;-&gt; mainstream slider', excellent 
design, cool name: Musicmobs has it all.&nbsp; It will be sad to see 
Musicmobs close its doors as Toby moves to Last.fm, but I am really 
excited to see what happens when you connect the vision that Toby has 
for Music 2.0 with the resources that Last.fm has.&nbsp;&nbsp; Congrats 
to Toby and kudos to Last.fm for building the social music dream team!

				<p>I had the opportunity to check out a beta version of <a href="https://spotify.com/">Spotify</a>
 recently, and&nbsp; I am really liking what I am 
seeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spotify is a music service that lets you 
listen to music on demand from a large number artists.</p><p align="center"><img src="support_files/spotify.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600"> <br></p><p>Spotify
 lets you create Pandora-like radio stations based upon a favorite 
artist.&nbsp; Instead of using the music genome to find similar tracks 
as Pandora does, and instead of using the wisdom of the crowds to 
populate their radio stations like last.fm does, they use the All Music 
'similar artists' data to populate their radio stations.&nbsp; Spotify 
makes good use of the AMG data too, they show artist bios, photos,&nbsp;
 and album art. </p><p>Spotify also has a genre/era based radio.&nbsp; 
You can choose from a set of 18 top level genres, and narrow down the 
year of interest to give you a focused, but artist independent radio 
station.</p><p align="center"><img src="support_files/spotify2.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="600">&nbsp;</p><p>Any
 song that you see in Spotify, you can play instantly. Apparently 
Spotify has (or is working on) arrangements with the labels to allow for
 this playback on demand.&nbsp; The playback was solid, good quality 
audio with minimal dropouts. It compared well to my experience with 
other streaming services like last.fm or Pandora. Spotify also lets you 
create playlists of tracks. Playlists are saved and you can play them 
back at anytime.&nbsp; Spotify may also be able to provide <a href="http://blog.gonze.com/2007/11/10/persistent-urls-for-songs/">persistent URLs</a> for songs ... something that the web has been needing for quite a while.<br></p><p>The next generation of music services are going to be all about giving listeners music on demand.&nbsp; Services like <a href="https://spotify.com/">Spotify</a>, <a href="http://www.finetune.com/">Finetune</a>, <a href="http://www.deezer.com/">Deezer</a>&nbsp;
 no longer are constrained by internet streaming rules - you can play 
songs by any artist at anytime.&nbsp; Soon the more established services
 like last.fm and Pandora will start to seem old fashioned - as they 
conform to the rather restrictive rules about internet radio enforced by
 SoundExchange.&nbsp; <br></p>

				<p>If I were in London tomorrow I would head over to Mile End road to hear <a href="http://www.computationalculture.de/2007/11/07/a-blueprint-for-emotional-music-recommenders/">Stephan Baumann</a> give a talk on his ideas about the future of music recommendation. Stephan's talk: <i>In Search of the Goosebump Factor - A Blueprint for Emotional Music Recommenders:&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Here's the abstract:</p><blockquote><p>Music Information Retrieval (MIR) as an interdisciplinary research
discipline achieved impressive progress over the last decade. Pandora,
Last.fm or MyStrands are successful commercial webservices offering
previously unavailable convenience for customers. Although such systems
compute personalised recommendations based on relevance feedback on top
of content-based, expert-based or community metadata, the embedding of
emotional context is still a challenge. In my talk I will sketch a
blueprint towards an architecture of an emotional music recommender in
order to solve the abovementioned problem. The approach is in its
infancy but we have already the core ingredients developed. Lifestream
aggregation from Web2.0 platforms and the analysis of blog postings
will be aligned with the analysis of song lyrics. Furthermore we
propose an open Web2.0 platform in order to collect personal
descriptions of "goosebump sensations" when listening to music. This
collection will be available to researchers in the field to serve as a
common ground for training emotional classifiers.

This weekend, Cari and I took a road trip to Western New York state to 
visit a few colleges.  Today we had some free time so we took a visit to
 Niagara falls.  Neither of us had been there before. Since it was off 
season, most of the attractions were closed, which means there were not 
too many people there, so it was actually quite nice.

				What do you do if you want to build a music search engine that will 
allow people to search for tracks from any artist and instantly play 
them, but you really don't want to pay those pesky music licensing 
fees?&nbsp; Why stream music videos from YouTube of course. Just make 
sure that you hide the video.&nbsp; This is what <a href="http://songza.com/">Songza</a>
 is doing.&nbsp; Yep ... it is illegal to stream music on demand, but it
 is perfectly OK to stream music videos. What a crazy world. - (via T<a href="http://techdigest.tv/2007/11/songza_music_se.html">ech Digest</a>)

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Everyone is excited that Apple will be releasing an SDK for the 
iPhone in February.&nbsp; This could potentially open up many avenues 
for new types of interfaces to interact with one's music 
collection.&nbsp; Imagine<a href="http://www.di.fm/edmguide/edmguide.html"> Ishkur's Guide to Dance</a> music on your phone, or one of Masataka's and/or Elias's fantastic interfaces&nbsp; like <a href="https://staff.aist.go.jp/m.goto/Musicream/">MusicReam,</a> <a href="https://staff.aist.go.jp/elias.pampalk/MusicRainbow/">MusicRainbow</a> or <a href="http://pampalk.at/MusicSun/">MusicSun, </a>or Frederic Vavrille's <a href="http://musicovery.com/">Musicovery,</a> or our own <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/emergingtech/?p=737">Search Inside the Music</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>My
 worry is that the when it comes to the music the iPhone SDK will be 
crippled - that the SDK will not provide for basic manipulation of the 
music queue and that we won't be able to write new music 
apps.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will all know for sure in February, but in the mean
 time I want to make sure that Apple knows what it should include in the
 API to support music apps.&nbsp; Here's the absolute minimum:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;Basic Player controls</li><ul><li>Start playing a song</li><li>Stop playing</li><li>Volume up/down</li><li>Pause/Resume</li></ul><li>Player events:</li><ul><li>Song Started</li><li>Song Finished</li><li>User skipped, user pause/resume<br></li><li>User volume up, volume down<br></li></ul><li>Basic Now Playing Queue controls</li><ul><li>Enqueue a song</li><li>Dequeue a song</li><li>Next song</li><li>Previous song</li></ul><li>Song database info</li><ul><li>Get info for a song including:</li><ul><li>title, artist, album, genre, composter</li><li>track number, year of release, length<br></li><li>playcount, skipcount, rating, BPM</li><li>bitrate, last played, format</li><li>album art</li></ul><li>Get all artists</li><li>Get all albums</li><li>Get all tracks</li><ul><li>by genre</li><li>by artist</li><li>by album</li></ul><li>Add a track to the database<br></li></ul><li>Playlist manipulation</li><ul><li>Get all playlists</li><li>Create a playlist</li><li>Delete a playlist</li><li>Get tracks in a playlist</li><li>Add tracks to a playlist<br></li></ul></ul><p>With
 this minimal SDK support for music we should see some really 
interesting apps for exploring our personal music collection.&nbsp; 
These apps will help prevent our iPod / iPhone from becoming the music 
graveyard - the place that our music goes to die.<br></p>
