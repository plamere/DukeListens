		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				One issue that is encountered when working with social tags is
synonymy, that is, taggers have lots of ways to say the same thing.
For instance, looking at the tags that have been applied to an artist 
like Jay-Z we see tags such as "Hip-hop", "hiphop", "hip hop" and
"rap".  Now it it pretty clear that "Hip-hop" and "hiphop" probably
mean the same thing. This diversity can be good sometimes - for
instance, if we know that "hip-hop" and "hip hop" usually mean the
same thing then if someone is searching for "hip-hop" we can include 
results that match "hip-hop" and "hip hop".   Of course, we could
figure out that "hip-hop" and "hip hop" are closely related just by
using text methods - but things are not usually so easy. What we'd
like to do is develop a method that can look at the set of tags and
determine which tags are synonyms, and which tags are closely related
but are probably not synonyms (such as "hip hop" and "rap").
<p>
For a first experiment, I'd like to see if I can automatically find 
synonyms for the tag "female vocalists".  To do this, I need to
establish some ground truth.  By hand, I've gone through the 5,000
most frequently applied artist tags, looking for tags that may be
related to "female vocalists".  I found 59 of them shown here (along
with the tag rank and tag frequency).

</p><pre>12 89277 female vocalists

Now I want to place the tags into 3 separate buckets - In bucket 1,
I'll put tags that I think  are synonyms for "female vocalists".  In
bucket 2, I'll put tags that are related but not synonyms, and in
bucket 3, I'll place tags that are not related to "female vocalists"
at all. 

<h2> Bucket #1 - Synonyms for "female vocalists"</h2>
These are female oriented tags (singular or plural), that don't imply any type of genre.
<pre>12 89277 female vocalists
80 15874 female
128 7150 female vocalist
236 2716 female vocals

3426 65 front girl band
3788 58 females
3884 56 woman
4370 49 Female solo artists
</pre>

<h2> Bucket #2 - Related but not synonyms to "Female Vocalists"</h2>
female-oriented tags that imply genre or include another type of qualifier such as 'favorite'.
<pre>113 8281 Female fronted metal
227 2841 riot grrrl
633 600 Girl Rock
786 433 riot grrl
880 374 female singer-songwriter
1064 289 chick rock
1067 287 girl power
1119 269 female singer-songwriters
1587 173 female rock
1625 167 female dance vocals
1727 154 french female
2130 118 Female-fronted Metal
2681 89 female fronted rock
2893 81 girlie rock
3077 75 japanese female vocalists
3194 71 girl pop
3201 71 eleCtro grrls
3609 62 60s girls
3676 60 grrl
3957 55 female vocal trance
4044 54 Female country
4188 51 grrls
4778 44 Favourite Females
4828 43 girl punk
4923 42 girls aloud
</pre>

<h2> Bucket #3 - Not related to "Female Vocalists" </h2>
<pre>(all of the rest of the 5,000 tags).
</pre>

Dividing the female-oriented tags like this is not so clear cut, but we 
have to start somewhere ... I'm open to any other suggestions as to how 
to divide this space up. Once we have some ground-truth (imperfect as it
 may be), we can develop an evaluation criteria that will let us 
determine how well our synonym detector works.
<p>
The next step is to figure out how we can evaluate our synonym
predictor.  That will be the next post.

			<h3><a href="open_notebook_science.html" title="permalink">Open Notebook Science</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				I've noticed a few articles and resources around open research in 
the last few weeks.  Last week, when I was visiting my parents in 
Florida, I noticed my Dad's copy of Scientific America had an excellent 
article called <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=science-2-point-0">Science 2.0 -- Is Open Access Science the Future?</a>
 that talks about the advantages and disadvantages of carrying out 
science in the open, on the web. The article suggests advantages such as
 a better dialog with people, and more opportunities for collaboration. 
 The article points to the <a href="http://www.openwetware.org/">OpenWetWare</a> project at MIT, which is a a wiki for biology researchers.
<p>
Another excellent resource is the <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail3705.html">podcast interview by Jon Udell of Jean-Claude Bradley</a>.
  Jean-Claude is a professor of chemistry at Drexel University who 
started to make the scientific process as transparent as possible by 
publishing all research work in real time to a collection of public 
blogs, wikis and other web pages. He coined the term Open Notebook 
Science which he <a href="https://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html">describes</a> as: "... there is a URL to a laboratory notebook (<a href="http://usefulchem.wikispaces.com/Exp025">like this</a>)
 that is freely available and indexed on common search engines. It does 
not necessarily have to look like a paper notebook but it is essential 
that all of the information available to the researchers to make their 
conclusions is equally available to the rest of the world. Basically, no
 insider information."
</p><p>
I really like the idea of 'no insider information' - to put all your 
successes and failures, every experiment, every bad result out there for
 everyone to see.  Your lab notebook is open for the whole world to see.
  
</p><p>
Jean-Claude has a <a href="http://precedings.nature.com/documents/39/version/1">presentation that outlines how they use Open Notebook science at Drexel</a>,
 that is pretty interesting (albeit, quite focused on chemistry). They 
use a Wiki to serve as the lab notebook. They rely on the automatic 
versioning of the wiki software to maintain track of edits, so they 
always know 'who did what' and 'when'. This addresses some of the 
concerns <a href="https://mir-research.blogspot.com/2008/06/open-research.html">Elias raised</a> about making the research record be permanent. They will then use their blog to highlight interesting results or questions. 
</p><p>
To me, this is all pretty interesting, especially for the Music 
Information Retrieval community. The MIR community has lots of 
disciplines: musicology, signal processing, machine learning, library 
science, text IR, coding, user interface, and on on.  No one can know 
all there is to know in this field, so anything that can help increase 
the opportunities for sharing ideas can really push forward the whole 
research community. 
</p><p>
There are already a number of MIR researchers that are putting their research on line. ( <a href="https://beyondbagofframes.blogspot.com/">Mark Godfrey</a> <a href="http://blog.dbtune.org/">Yves Raimond</a>
 to name just a couple).  I suspect that more researchers would work 
this way if the tools were available and the advantages were laid out.  
Perhaps this would be a good topic for a panel at ISMIR this year.  
Since Jean-Claude Bradley is at Drexel there could even be an 
opportunity to have Jean-Claude sit on the panel to serve as the 
'expert'.  This panel could be about how to do 'open notebook science' 
with some feedback from folks who are already doing that in the MIR 
community.  I, myself, would find this panel to be very interesting.
</p><p>
Of course, we are way past the time to submit panels to ISMIR, so there 
may not be any chance to have such a panel, but it doesn't hurt to try 
.. so if enough MIR folks express some interest to me (just add a 
comment to this post or send me an email), I'll talk with the ISMIR 
organizers to see if this would be possible.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				The organizers for <a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/">ISMIR 2008</a> have just posted the <a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/tutorials">schedule for tutorials</a> for this year's conference.  Among them is a tutorial that will be presented by <a href="http://www.jj-aucouturier.info/">Jean-Julien Aucouturier</a>, <a href="https://mir-research.blogspot.com/">Elias Pampalk</a> and myself entitled <strong>Social Tags and Music Information Retrieval</strong>.  Here are the details:
<p>
<cite>Social Tags are free text labels that are applied to items such as
 artists, playlists and songs. These tags have the potential to have a 
positive impact on music information retrieval research. In this 
tutorial we describe the state of the art in commercial and research 
social tagging systems for music. We explore some of the motivations for
 tagging. We describe the factors that affect the quantity and quality 
of collected tags. We present a toolkit that MIR researchers can use to 
harvest and process tags. We look at how tags are collected and used in 
current commercial and research systems. We explore some of the issues 
and problems that are encountered when using tags. We present current 
MIR-related research centered on social tags and suggest possible areas 
of exploration for future research.</cite>
</p><p>
I am really excited about working on this tutorial with Elias and JJ. One of the highlights of 2007 for me was presenting a <a href="http://mtg.upf.edu/%7Eocelma/MusicRecommendationTutorial-ISMIR2007/">tutorial on music recommendation</a> with <a href="http://mtg.upf.edu/%7Eocelma/">Oscar Celma</a>.
 I learned so much about the subject matter while preparing the 
tutorial, and it was great fun to work with someone as smart as Oscar.  I
 am really looking forward to repeating the experience.

				Just for fun,  I wrote a little program that takes the set of <a href="looking_for_genres.html">genres</a> and mixes them up to give us a whole new set of imaginary genres.  Some of my favorite imaginary genres are:


  <ul> 
    <li>Acid Rockabilly
</li>
    <li>British Hip Pop
</li>
    <li>Blackened Broken Metal
</li>
    <li>British Stoner Rap
</li>
    <li>Coast Rock
</li>
    <li>Depressive political rock 
</li>
    <li>Dirty Neo-Prog
</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=emo+metal">Emo Metal</a> </li>
    <li>German uplifting death-grind 
</li>
    <li>Gothic country grrrl 
</li>
    <li>Hardcore chick trance 
</li>
    <li>Indie anarcho pop 
</li>
    <li>Industrial old northern house
</li>
    <li>Liquid Psychedelia 
</li>
    <li>New symphonic hip-hop
</li>
    <li>Organic Metal
</li>
    <li>Progressive teen Hardcore 
</li>
    <li>Suicidal Swedish viking rock 
</li>
    <li>Traditional ambient deutschpunk
</li>
    <li>Twee Afrobeat
</li>
  </ul> 
I think would be really cool to listen to some of these genres (such as 
'Twee Afrobeat' or 'Liquid Psychedelia') and I think some (such as 'new 
symphonic hip-hop') would be just horrid.  The weird thing is that I can
 imagine what many of these genres would sound like, even though they 
don't exist.  Just try to imagine what 'Gothic Country Grrrl' would 
sound like.

				I took a tour by hand through the top 1,500 last.fm artist tags to
identify which ones were related to genre. I found about 700 of them,
ranging from the familiar 'rock', 'indie' and 'jazz' to 'aggrotech',
'true Norwegian black metal', and 'terror ebm'. It is actually quite a
it of work filtering the tags like this. I had to look up many tags
like '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angura_kei">angura kei</a>'  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggalo">'juggalo'</a> to see if they were genre related.  And I am sure I made many mistakes.  Some of my favorites are:

  
  
  
  
  <ul> 
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_grrl">riot grrl

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Steve asked me how many words are in a typical<a href="open_research_the_data_lastfm.html"> Last.fm artist tag</a>.
 So lets answer that question.  Of the 100,000 or so unique tags, about 
33% of them are single word tags (like 'rock', 'emo' and 'metal'), 36% 
are two word tags (like 'heavy metal', 'punk rock' and 'seen live'), 16%
 are three word tags ('brutal death metal'), 6% are 4 word tags ('asian 
drum and bass'), 3% are 5 word tags ('sounds awesome in my car').  The 
longest tag is 49 words long. It is:
<blockquote>i am a child in a field and i grow things in my dreams to 
wake and water them to go to sleep and raise them from the earth into 
existence from an idea to physical existence what power what madness a 
gentle madness an eleven year olds madness</blockquote>
The longest tag that has been applied multiple times is:
<blockquote>songs that i sing along to but i always forget the words so i
 say duh duh while trying to sound like i do know the words and no one 
is falling for it but they keep quiet because they are embarassed for me</blockquote>
<p>
Some long tags that seem to be about music :
</p><blockquote>bands or people from india or who sound like they might 
be from india or who sound like they might be from around india or who 
sound like they might enjoy bands or people who sound like they are from
 around india
</blockquote>
A number of the longer tags seem to be the result of someone being 
confused about how to enter separate tags. For example, this single tag 
was probably meant to be 20 individual tags:
<blockquote>rock - metal - industrial - electronic - punk - emo - ebm - 
alternative - punk - dark electro - japanese - metalcore - female 
fronted metal - techno - psytrance - love metal - new wave - synth pop -
 indie</blockquote>
<p>
Some long single word tags:

34 Progressive-Industrial-Atmospheric

Once again, many of these seem to be the results of the confused tagger not understanding how to apply multiple tags at once.
<p>
317 Unique tags that start with "I ..." such as:
</p><pre>11 I would like to own or listen to more music by these bands and artists
11 I got a patch
11 I dig it
11 I dig
10 I must try
10 I can be cool sometimes
10 I LOVE THIS MUSIC
10 I Have Seen Them
9 I think its a doom metal band
9 I like this stuff
9 I cant account for these
9 I am so sad
8 I love this bands
8 I love them all
8 I like this music
8 I like this
8 I like these guys a lot</pre>
My favorite is: <em>I was never a Swedish teenager with swedish teen angst so now I will attempt at having it</em>. Speaking of 'favorite', Last.fm taggers have hundreds of ways of tagging their favorite artists. Among them are:
<pre>FavoriteArtists
favoritebands
FAVORTIEEESSS
Favoritmusik
Favoritizims
favoritttes
favoiteness

Tags can be crazy - there are just so many different reasons why people 
tag, there's tons of noise, there are tag abusers - but because there 
are so many tags, they can also be extremely useful.  Next up, we'll try
 to sift through the tags and categorize them into big buckets like 
genre, mood, opinion and so on.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				The <a href="open_research_the_data_lastfm.html">LastFM-ArtistTags2007</a> dataset has 100,000 unique artist tags for about 20,000 artists.  Let's take a closer look at some of the data.
<p>
First, here's a plot of tag frequency.  First thing to notice is the 
power distribution. Not surprisingly, it looks like tags follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf's la</a>w
 (where the frequency of a tag is inversely proportional to its rank). 
Interestingly, 45,000 of the 100,000 or so tags have been applied only 
once. 
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_tag.freq.full.png"><img src="support_files/_tag_002.png" alt="tag.freq.full.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
Looking at a log-log plot of the frequency vs. rank data, we see that 
the data is linear starting at a rank around 25.  For tags at rank less 
than 25 we see a tailing off from Zipf's law.  I think this tailing off 
is to be expected.  The most applied tag 'rock' is not really very 
descriptive.  I suspect that many taggers will self-edit and not apply 
obvious tags.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_tag.freq.log.log.png"><img src="support_files/_tag_003.png" alt="tag.freq.log.log.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
This next plot gives a closer look at the 5,000 most frequently applied 
tags.  In this dataset, about 2,500 tags have been applied 100 times or 
more.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_tag.freq.detail.png"><img src="support_files/_tag.png" alt="tag.freq.detail.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
The top 25 tags applied are:
</p><p>
</p><pre>440854 rock
343901 seen live
277747 indie
245259 alternative
184491 metal
158252 electronic
136691 punk
124599 pop
119930 indie rock
102937 classic rock
97264 alternative rock
89277 female vocalists
79497 emo
77455 death metal
76898 Hip-Hop
76668 hardcore
74650 electronica
73034 singer-songwriter
69169 black metal
62284 jazz
60559 hard rock
59763 folk
59729 punk rock
58135 Progressive rock
57860 heavy metal
54398 industrial</pre>
<p>
In the top 25, almost all of the tags are genre related (with the 
exception of 'seen live' and 'female vocalists').  The data appears to 
skew away from what one would expect from a general listening 
population.  There's no 'Country' in the top 25, but there are 4 kinds 
of metal. 
</p><p>
In future posts, I'll take a closer look at the various types of tags.

	<div class="entry-content">
				For this Open Research experiment, I shall be working with a set of 
social tag collected from Last.fm via Audioscrobbler web services.  
Since it might be handy for anyone following along to have access to the
 same data set, I am making this data set available directly for any 
researcher who wants to use it.  
<p>
The dataset is available for download here: <a href="http://mediacast.sun.com/users/lamere/media/Lastfm-ArtistTags2007">Lastfm-ArtistTags2007</a>
</p><p>
Here are the details as told in  the README file:

</p><pre><strong>The LastFM-ArtistTags2007 Data set
</strong>Version 1.0
June 2008

<strong>What is this?
</strong>
    This is a set of artist tag data collected from Last.fm using
    the <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/data/webservices/">Audioscrobbler webservice</a> during the spring of 2007.

    The data consists of the raw tag counts for the 100 most
    frequently occuring tags that Last.fm listeners have applied
    to over 20,000 artists.

    An undocumented (and deprecated) option of the audioscrobbler
    web service was used to bypass the Last.fm normalization of tag
    counts.  This data set provides raw tag counts.

<strong>Data Format:
</strong>
  The data is formatted one entry per line as follows:

  musicbrainz-artist-id&lt;sep&gt;artist-name&lt;sep&gt;tag-name&lt;sep&gt;raw-tag-count

<strong>Example:
</strong>
    11eabe0c-2638-4808-92f9-1dbd9c453429&lt;sep&gt;Deerhoof&lt;sep&gt;american&lt;sep&gt;14
    11eabe0c-2638-4808-92f9-1dbd9c453429&lt;sep&gt;Deerhoof&lt;sep&gt;animals&lt;sep&gt;5
    11eabe0c-2638-4808-92f9-1dbd9c453429&lt;sep&gt;Deerhoof&lt;sep&gt;art punk&lt;sep&gt;21
    11eabe0c-2638-4808-92f9-1dbd9c453429&lt;sep&gt;Deerhoof&lt;sep&gt;art rock&lt;sep&gt;18
    11eabe0c-2638-4808-92f9-1dbd9c453429&lt;sep&gt;Deerhoof&lt;sep&gt;atmospheric&lt;sep&gt;4
    11eabe0c-2638-4808-92f9-1dbd9c453429&lt;sep&gt;Deerhoof&lt;sep&gt;avantgarde&lt;sep&gt;3


<strong>Data Statistics:
</strong>
    Total Lines:      952810
    Unique Artists:    20907
    Unique Tags:      100784
    Total Tags:      7178442

<strong>Filtering:
</strong>
    Some minor filtering has been applied to the tag data.  Last.fm will
    report tag with counts of zero or less on occasion. These tags have
    been removed.

    Artists with no tags have not been included in this data set.
    Of the nearly quarter million artists that were inspected, 20,907
    artists had 1 or more tags.

<strong>Files</strong>:

    ArtistTags.dat  - the tag data

				Last.fm is extending its reach with a new program called <a href="https://mashable.com/2008/06/04/lastfm-in-a-box/">Last.fm in a Box</a>.  <em>Last.fm in a box</em> will allow Last.fm partners to embed the Last.fm ad-supported player in their site.  From the Press Release: <em>The
 service is dubbed "Last.fm in a Box" because it’s a complete 
"soundtrack for the Web" experience for users—featuring millions of 
tracks from Last.fm’s unparalleled music catalogue. Based on the open 
platform of Last.fm, partner sites can adopt "Last.fm in a Box" simply, 
easily and quickly. The service will be ad-supported allowing brands and
 sponsors the opportunity to reach millions of highly engaged music fans
 across the Web beyond the Last.fm site.</em>
<p>
I found it interesting to see the teen/pre-teen site <a href="http://www.stardoll.com/en/">Stardoll.com</a>
 as one of the "last.fm in a box" partners. This could be an interesting
 clash of cultures as the 13 year old girls start pushing their 
scrobbles into last.fm's music brain, while the old-school last.fm users
 push back with their <a href="the_1_brutal_death_metal.html">nefarious tagging of pop music</a>.

Sten is now <a href="http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sanderson/">blogging about Java and development</a>. Sten has a dry sense of humor that make these informative posts fun to read.  An example, Sten talks about IntelliJ IDEA: <em>I
 approached this IDE with suspicion, mostly because I didn’t trust its 
CamelCase spelling.  However, I figured that they were trying to spell 
“Intelligent”, which I could certainly relate to, but made a typo with 
the “J”, got flustered, stopped, and tried to distract from this blunder
 by shouting the second word.</em>
