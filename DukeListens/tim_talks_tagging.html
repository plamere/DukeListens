			<h2>Tim Talks Tagging</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Tim, the curator of <a href="https://www.librarything.com/thingology/2007/02/when-tags-works-and-when-they-dont.php">LibraryThing,</a> has a <a href="https://www.librarything.com/thingology/2007/02/when-tags-works-and-when-they-dont.php">mega-post about tagging</a>.&nbsp; Tim compares the tagging systems of Amazon and LibraryThing and postulates why LibraryThing users have applied <b>ten times</b>
 the number of tags that Amazon users have, even though the number of 
LibraryThing users is so much smaller than Amazon users. Tim goes on to 
offer advice as to how to make an eCommerce tagging work (with a hint 
that perhaps it is not too late for Amazon can catch up if they can 
scrape together about $5.76)<br></p><p>Tim talks about the problem with 
'opinion tags' especially when tagging is light. Tim points to the 
difference in tags for Ann Coulter's book 'Terrorism' - Amazon has 
user&nbsp; tags like "craptacular," "evil" and "brain dead while 
LibraryThing's has tags like <span style="font-size: 11px;"><a href="https://www.librarything.com/tag/20th+century" target="_top">20th century</a><span class="count">(1)</span> </span><span style="font-size: 11px;"><a href="https://www.librarything.com/tag/21st+c." target="_top">21st c.</a><span class="count">(1)</span> </span><span style="font-size: 11px;"><a href="https://www.librarything.com/tag/america+1975-present" target="_top">america 1975-present</a><span class="count">(1)</span> </span><span style="font-size: 11px;"><a href="https://www.librarything.com/tag/American+History" target="_top">American History</a><span class="count">(1)</span> </span><span style="font-size: 15px;"><span class="count"></span> </span><span style="font-size: 15px;"><b><a href="https://www.librarything.com/tag/cold+war" target="_top">cold war</a></b><span class="count">(2)</span> </span><span style="font-size: 15px;"><a href="https://www.librarything.com/tag/commentary" target="_top">commentary</a><span class="count">(2)</span> </span><span style="font-size: 15px;"><b><a href="https://www.librarything.com/tag/Conservatism" target="_top">Conservatism</a></b></span>-
 I find it interesting that none of the LibraryThing tags are opinion 
based, while almost all of Amazon's tags are.&nbsp; I think this may 
point more to a cultural difference between LibraryThing and Amazon's 
users.&nbsp; Amazon has&nbsp; a long history of cultivating&nbsp; a<i> culture of critique.</i>&nbsp;
 Amazon users are accustomed to and encouraged to offer their opinions 
about everything they see on Amazon.&nbsp; Amazon's customers write 
reviews, they rate products, they make lists of products that they 
recommend. With this <i>culture of critique</i> it is not surprising 
that Amazon's tags are opinion-centered. LibraryThing, on the other 
hand, is more oriented toward people who want to organize their book 
collections.&nbsp; With this <i>culture of organization</i>, we see tags that are more subject-oriented.&nbsp; Amazon's tags are essentially one word <i>reviews</i>, while LibraryThings are one word <i>descriptions.</i></p><p>Tim talks about why people tag without using the word <i>selfish.</i>&nbsp;
 I think the best tagging systems (last.fm, delicious, and LibraryThing 
come to mind) work well because the prime motivation for tagging is a 
selfish one - people tag to organize their personal stuff (whether it is
 music, the web, or books).&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp; system like last.fm or 
LibraryThing aggregates these thousands of selfish behaviors for the 
good of all. </p><p>It's clear from Tim's post that Tim spends a lot of 
time thinking about tagging.&nbsp; I'm guessing that it is Tim's passion
 for tagging that is at the heart of the success of LibraryThing.&nbsp; 
Tim is asking a lot of interesting questions about tagging - and he has 
the luxury of being able to try out his theories about tagging on a site
 with hundreds of thousands of users and millions and millions of 
tags&nbsp; - that is a luxury that very few people have.<br></p>

But if the motivation is selfish, then won't the tags be selfish, too?  
That is not a value judgment.  That is an operational caveat.

What I mean is, if I am tagging something for my own personal (selfish) 
use, I am not going to use labels like 20th Century, American history, 
cold war, etc.  I am going to use labels that are relevant to me.  For 
example, when tagging my music collection, I tend to use tags like "high
 school" to label that subset of my collection that I was really into 
back then.  Or "dance teaching" for those songs I used regularly when I 
was a ballroom dance instructor in Massachusetts.  Or "Whatshername" for
 those songs that remind me of that ex.  

None of those selfish tags are going to be useful to anyone.  It doesn't
 matter that Last.fm aggregates my tags into the whole; what I have 
produced is of little use to anyone.  Ok, maybe there is another dance 
teacher out there, one that would agree with my labeling of the Beatles'
 "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" with the "dance instruction" label ("foxtrot"
 actually).  But "high school"?  And "whatshername"?  These aren't just 
opinion tags.  These are personal, selfish tags, tags that are 
specificly relevant to me, and to me alone.  

How does tagging overcome this sort of problem?

                paul--

i agree with you that the best tagging systems are selfish. and i hear 
you on delicious and library thing. 

but last.fm? please explain to me the "selfish" value of tagging on 
last.fm. 

on delicious and library thing you have explicit collections of "your" 
objects (bookmarks or books). i'm not seeing the equivalent on last.fm. 

but maybe i'm missing something. please help me out . . .

You are right that tagging on last.fm is a bit different than 
LibraryThing.  Typically, when you tag on last.fm you are listening to 
last.fm radio, not your own personal collection, so people are not 
tagging to organize their personal collections like they do on 
LibraryThing.  But, people still tag quite often on last.fm, and I think
 that it is still a selfish tagging - people tag on last.fm to organize 
their listening.

                Jeremy - It is really interesting to look at how people 
use tags - hundreds of thousands of last.fm users have tagged hundreds 
of thousands of tracks as 'rock' (for what purpose I don't know, 'cause 
we knew it was 'rock' didn't we?), Britney Spears has been tagged 
'officially sh*t' 126 times (a hundred times less than Paris Hilton 
btw).  The second most common tag on last.fm is 'seen live' - perhaps 
this tag doesn't say too much about the song or artist that is being 
tagged, (just like your 'highschool' tag), but it does say something 
about the tagger.  With the 'seen live' tag, we now have a pretty good 
way to find similar taggers - and given a large enough body of taggers, 
some really interesting tags emerge - leading to all sorts of 
interesting possibilities ('lord of the rings' radio for instance).

                I understand the excitement and impetus for wanting all 
these tags.  And I would love to play with all this data, myself. 
<p>
But I still need to hear a more convincing story told, something other 
than "really interesting tags emerge", with "all sorts of interesting 
possibilities".  I am not saying this with any sort of criticism; I just
 really want to understand what we think really will emerge...or what 
has emerged already from tagging sites like Flickr.  (I'm not exactly 
sure what you mean by LOTR radio.)
</p><p>
Because on the one hand, I share some of this optimism.  Even for a very
 personal tag like "danceteaching", it could very well be that someone 
else finds my tag useful, and I therefore find someone else's tag 
useful.  Given a large enough body of people using the tag 
"danceteaching", something interesting could come out.
</p><p>
But on the other hand, I do not share this optimism.  When I think about
 a tag like danceteaching (or 'seen live' or whatever), that has so many
 different meanings.  Are they talking about ballroom?  Square dancing? 
 Capoeira?  Salsa?  Hula?  And even when they are talking about 
ballroom, do they mean foxtrot?  Waltz?  Tango, quickstep, rumba, cha 
cha, jive, etc?  And even if they mean, say, "ballroom cha cha, breaking
 (in the international style) on 2, rather than in the American style on
 1 (the music is indeed slightly different), what can I conclude from 
that?  What user community can I create from that?  I think about my 6-7
 fellow dance instructors back in Massachusetts, all the people that 
would have labeled such a song with a "break on 2 international ballroom
 cha cha dance instruction" label, and then I think about the music in 
the rest of their collection.  And I probably don't want to listen to 
much of it, if any.  One guy likes country.  One likes electronica.  
Another woman is into sappy ballads.  So what community are we going to 
form around this "danceinstruction" tag?
</p><p>
I am totally positive about people trying to play with tags like this.  I
 would love to, myself, if I had access to all this data.  But 
ultimatly, I remain wary about what we (1) will actually accomplish, and
 (2) could actually accomplish.  And how much data will we actually 
need, before something becomes truly useful?
