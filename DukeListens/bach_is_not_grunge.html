				We are building a&nbsp; system that is trained to predict social 
tags for music.&nbsp; Our system will try to 'learn' what social tags 
should be applied to an mp3 file based solely on the audio 
content.&nbsp; The system works rather well for most kinds of music, but
 we've been seeing some particular problems with music that is labeled 
'grunge'.&nbsp; Bands that you'd think would be labeled as 'strong 
grunge' - bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam - are only mildly grunge 
according to our system.&nbsp; This has been a bit of a mystery, until 
this week when we added a feature that lets us search through our 
predicted tag space - with this feature we can find the most 'metal' 
(Good Riddance, Atheist), the most 'folk' (Bob Dylan, Cat Power), and 
the most 'electronica' (aphex twin, Jake Fairley). &nbsp; However for 
the most 'grunge' we didn't see Nirvana, or Pearl Jam (nor even Courtney
 Love), instead the most 'grunge' artists were Johann Sebastian Bach, 
Charlie Parker, Glenn Gould and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.&nbsp; Clearly 
this isn't right - so we dug in to see what was happening.&nbsp; We 
looked at the training data for the 'grunge' tag - sure enough it was 
filled with non-grunge artists, classical, jazz and spoken word - so 
instead of learning 'grunge' we were learning randomness (and 
woe).&nbsp; Thierry quickly found and fixed the problem (it was a 
problem with how we were normalizing tag counts) - so now we are 
retraining a bunch of our tags - with hopefully even better results 
coming.&nbsp; Clearly though, we need to think a bit more about adding 
some basic sanity checks - so we don't happily go though life thinking 
Bach is grunge.<br>

<p>Will your tagging algorithm ever be able to tell the difference 
between impressionism (Debussy), serialism (Boulez), expressionism 
(Varese), neoclassicism (Prokofiev), minimalism (Glass), drone (La Monte
 Young), nationalism (Sibelius), romaticism (Tchaikovsky), baroque 
(Vivaldi), sturm und drang (Haydn), or lyricism (Schubert)?</p>


<p>All classical music can't be lumped together into one bundle. 
(Someone once told me that the main differentiator between classical and
 pop is: anything longer that 3 1/2 minutes is classical).</p>


<p>There are a zillion styles in so-called classical music. And a 
zillion composers around the world, very much alive, writing music for 
"classical" ensembles and audiences. </p>


<p>Just listen to one of my radio programs (rchrd.com/mfom) and try to figure out how to categorize the style, or even the period. </p>


<p>Any reasonable ear can tell the difference between Schubert and Debussy. They use the same 12 notes per octave. </p>


<p>But it's the difference that is amazing.</p>


<p>Is anybody looking into this? Or is just pop music of interest 
(because of the inherent commercial value .. one thing that so-called 
classical music lacks -- commercial value)?</p>


<p>I'd like to know.</p>

<p>I don't know how well we'd fare distinguishing between different 
periods and styles of classical music - we haven't tried it yet.  To 
train our system, we need lots of well labeled music.  We can get this 
data via web mining music sites like last.fm - but this does skew our 
models to be primarily focused on popular/commercial music.  There just 
isn't a good source of social tags for classical music. If there was 
such a source, we would use it.  Classical music fans don't seem to be 
as aggressive about tagging as indie music fans are.</p>


<p>Classical music is not forgotten though.  For instance, at this 
year's MIREX (the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange), 
there is a 'classical composer identification' contest. The task is to 
identify the composer of a number of pieces of classical music from the 
baroque, classical and romantic periods.  The identification is to be 
made using only the audio.  The contest will include music by Bach, 
Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Dvorak, Handel, Hayden, Mendelssohn, Mozart, 
Schubert and Vivaldi.</p>


<p>You can read more about the evaluation here: <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/mirex2007/index.php/Audio_Composer_Identification" rel="nofollow">http://www.music-ir.org/mirex2007/index.php/Audio_Composer_Identification</a></p>

<p>I wonder if Bird and Bach use the same quietLOUDquiet structure that 
Nirvana borrowed from the Pixies?  If that kind of structural element is
 used as an identifier in the acoustic analysis, I wonder if that would 
be seen as a similarity. </p>
