			<h2>How many iTunes songs have *you* bought?</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				
<br>Sometime during the first quarter of 2006 Apple sold its 50 
millionth iPod.&nbsp; Right around the same time, Apple celebrated 
selling its 1 <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/1billion/" target="_self">*billionth*</a>
 song on iTunes.&nbsp; A phenomenal achievement.&nbsp; Or was it?&nbsp; 
Dividing the the billion songs by the 50 million iPods yields a grand 
total of an average of 20 songs sold by Apple per iPod.&nbsp; So after 
spending $200 or $300 or even more on a luxury music player, the average
 person is only spending $20 to put iTunes music on it.<br><br>I've had 
an iPod for a couple of years now. I have probably about 5,000 songs on 
it.&nbsp; I have always considered myself atypical in that I had 
purchased just a handful of songs from iTunes.&nbsp; A quick check shows
 that I have purchased only 51 songs from iTunes, less than two per 
month.&nbsp; However, this means that I purchase iTunes songs&nbsp; 2.5 
times the rate of the average iPod owner.&nbsp; So instead of being a 
rare iTunes shopper, I'm a frequent buyer!&nbsp; <br><br>One has to 
wonder if Apple is making any money from those billion 
songs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the typical iPod user is just buying one iTunes 
song per month, the credit card transaction fees have to be eating up 
any potential profits.<br><br>Now, if Apple decided to offer an 
all-you-can-eat plan like Napster or Yahoo, I'm guessing that they'd be 
able to convert a non-insignificant fraction of their 50 million iPod 
owners to $10 per month subscribers.&nbsp; At the same time, the 
Napsters, Yahoos and Rhapsodies are hoping that the <a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2006/06/19/Pressure_still_on_for_Apples_DRM/" target="_self">DRM flap</a>
 that Apple is facing in Europe will end with Apple being forced to open
 up their DRM, if&nbsp; that happens, Apple may be forced to compete and
 will finally offer up their own subscription service.<br><br>

                It's amazing how flawed your logic is. I seriously hope 
Sun does not use similar statistics to roll out and sell it's own 
products..., although that would explain a lot.

                I've purchased 273 tracks - 22 complete CDs/EPs, and a 
bunch of individual songs. I bought my first track (Kitaro's <i>Space II</i>) on March 21, 2004, and my most recent album (the Legendary Pink Dots' <i>Your Children Placate You From Premature Graves</i>) today.

Do I win a prize?

                You write, <i>" If the typical iPod user is just buying 
one iTunes song per month, the credit card transaction fees have to be 
eating up any potential profits."</i> And of course they're not. An iPod
 user is much more likely to buy one 12-track CD every year than one 
track each month. Even when they buy individual tracks, the purchases 
tend to be clustered. And of course Apple combines individual purchases 
wherever possible before charging your credit card.

                Geoff:  Nice to hear from you!  Indeed, there are all 
sorts of usage pattern variables here.  My usage pattern has been 
different than yours, where I'll hear a song on the radio or see it well
 placed on last.fm and decide to listen to the song a few times, so I am
 in the once-song-a-month camp.

                I am not an iPod owner but I am an avid iTunes user.  To
 muddy the waters even further, I have ~2500 audio tracks in my 
collection, none of them from the iTunes Music Store, but I do have four
 or five episodes of Lost that I missed during the week and had to 
purchase from iTunes. (This was before ABC was giving them away for 
free).

                PDid,

What about the logic is flawed?  The fact that Paul reported an average 
consumption rate, and implicitly presumes that most people are Gaussian 
centered around the mean?  Of course we all know that behavior like this
 is not Gaussian, but follows more of a Zipf curve.  But so what?  The 
average still holds true.  If one person buys 273 tracks, that means 
that there will be a fair number of other people that only bought 2-3 
tracks.

As for myself, I own an iPod, but have never bought a single track.  I 
use it primarily for podcast listening in the car, as the iTunes podcast
 interface is quite user-friendly.  I guess I am one of those pulling 
the average down.

                Well, iPods sell worldwide. But iTunes MS is available 
only in few countries. Many iPod owners simply CAN'T buy songs from 
iTMS.
