	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>
In Neal Stephensen's <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">'In the Beginning
... Was the Command Line'</a>, Neal argues that the command-line interface
"opens a much more direct and explicit channel from user to machine
than the GUI".  I agree, for most tasks, I find that a 'bash' shell,
a text editor, and the suite of Unix commands is the most efficient set
of tools.   But ... don't try to write a command shell in Java!  
</p><p> 

In Java, it is not possible to perform raw console I/O, only line 
buffered I/O is possible. The user has to hit [return] before your app 
sees what the user typed. This means that interactive command-line 
editing, password input (where the characters typed are not echoed) or <i>curses</i> style apps  are not possible in Java. Without this capability it is impossible
to write good interactive text apps.  You could not write <i>bash</i> 
in Java, you could not write a non-GUI <i>vi</i> or <i>emacs</i>.
</p><p>
<a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4050435">Bug
4050435</a> "Improved interactive console I/O (password prompting, line editing)" is number 11 on the list of <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/top25_rfes.do">Top RFEs</a>
 at the
Java Bug Parade. This RFE is to provide an API to give Java the ability 
to
put the console in raw mode, to allow for character by character input
and output to the terminal.  It seems like simple, almost trivial 
functionality to add to the Java platform, and it would allow the 
writing of a whole class of applications.   However,
given that the RFE has been outstanding for <b>Seven Years</b>, it is 
unlikely that we'll be seeing a Java command line in the near future. 
But you can help. This RFE only needs about 25 more votes to move it 
into the top 10 RFEs.  If you think Java console apps are important, add
 your vote to have this RFE fixed.  Seven years is a long time to wait 
for such an important thing.

                I use the command line quite a bit. But it's 
disingenuous to laud the command line as "a much more direct and 
explicit channel from user to machine." The same can be said for 
assembly language, or even machine language. "Direct and explicit" is a 
DISadvantage for most everyday work; you don't WANT to have to fuss over
 irrelevant details.

And BTW, it's not Java that requires that you hit the enter key, it's 
your operating system.

                You say that "The user has to hit [return] before your 
app sees what the user typed."

Well this is not really true as you can wrap System.in within an 
InputStreamReader and read one (or more) character at a time and have 
the program react accordingly to what the user types in.

In a recent blog 
(http://radio.javaranch.com/channel/val/2004/06/09/1086777039000.html), I
 use this technique for asking the user what he wants to do. I'm not 
sure whether this is the goal you are aiming at. Please don't hesitate 
to comment on that.
Thanks :)

                Val:

Thanks for the comment. One can indeed read a character at a time, 
however, no matter what you do, the characters are buffered. If your app
 has a loop where it is reading a single character from System.in, the 
loop will block in during the  first read  waiting for the user to input
 a character. The user can type in characters all day, but this read 
will not return until the user hits the [return] key. Once the [return] 
is hit, the read will indeed return the first character typed (and 
subsequent reads will return the rest). I would like to be able to do 
two things: (1) Perform single character-at-a-time input from System.in,
 (2) Disable the automatic echoing of characters as they are typed.  (1)
 is necessary to allow any sort of command line editing (up arrow to get
 to previous commands in your command history for instance). (2) is 
necessary for writing things like password getting routines that echo 
'*****' when someone is typing their password.

Thanks for the info...
By the way, did you like Neal's book? I have it on my shelf (as well as 
all his books), but I can't find the courage (or time?) to get my 
technical ones down :\

                Val - I did like Neal's book (essay really), it was a 
perfect book for a plane ride: a 2 hour read, thought provoking, and 
compact... unlike some of Neal's fiction such as the Cryptonomicon that 
requires its own carry-on bag.
