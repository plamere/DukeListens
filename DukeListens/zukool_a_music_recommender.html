			<h2>ZuKool - A Music recommender</h2>

				<p><a style="margin: 10px; float: left;" href="http://zukool.com/zwiBeta/site/index.html"><img src="support_files/sitelogo_hires_70pc.html" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a></p><p>ZuKool
 is a music recommender that shuns the "wisdom of the crowds" approach 
taken by most music recommenders.&nbsp; Instead, ZuKool&nbsp; provides 
song-level based recommendations based upon what the song sounds 
like.&nbsp; The ZuKool interface is quite simple to use.&nbsp; You just 
select a song or two that you know, click on the ZuKool red-eye and 
ZuKool will generate a playlist of songs that sound similar.&nbsp; You 
have some control over the type of songs recommended - you can restrict 
the recommendations to be only from music of the same style, or you can 
draw music from all styles, allowing for more serendipitous discovery of
 music.&nbsp; In some ways, this is similar to what Pandora does, 
recommending music based upon song level similarity, but ZuKool takes a 
very different approach.&nbsp; First of all, ZuKool is not a streaming 
internet radio service.&nbsp; They provide recommendations and 
opportunities to purchase music, but you can't turn it into a 
recommender-radio like you get at Pandora or last.fm.&nbsp; 
Second,&nbsp; Pandora uses humans to perform their music analysis.&nbsp;
 Although ZuKool doesn't explicitly say how they determine their song 
similarity, it is a pretty safe guess that they are&nbsp; using some 
sort of automated techniques to analyze their music.</p><p><img src="support_files/zuk.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p><p><b>The User Interface</b><br>The
 ZuKool user interface is well-designed and easy to use.&nbsp; One 
really nice aspect is that there are no advertisements cluttering up the
 interface.&nbsp; I had no problem figuring out how to use the system. 
They use an appropriate amount of Ajax - the system felt very 
interactive, with out lots of gratuitous (and CPU swallowing) 
animations.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="support_files/zuk1.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p>
<p>Using ZuKool is straightforward.&nbsp; Search for a an artist or song
 that you like, add it to your Songlist, click the scary red eye and you
 are given a set of songs that sound similar to your set of seed 
songs.&nbsp; Along the way, you can listen to 30 second clips of the 
songs (one glitch, the music didn't play on my linux box, but it worked 
fine on my mac), get more info about a song, and even purchase the album
 from Amazon or CD Baby.<br></p><p><img src="support_files/zuk2.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p><p><br>Although
 ZuKool seems to have lots of music in its collection (they claim about 
600,000 songs), the majority is not mainstream music - much of the music
 looks to be from CDBaby.<br><br><b>The Recommendations:<br></b>The ZuKool recommenations were a bit hit or miss.&nbsp; I first tried the song <i>Eleanor Rigby</i>
 by the Beatles.&nbsp; I was pleased to see a recommendation for a 
Mozart String Quartet and a recommendation for the string-laden <i>Taking my life in your hands</i>
 by Elvis Costello.&nbsp; Those are the types of recommendations that 
highlight the strengths of&nbsp; a content-based recommender - they can 
help you make serendipitous music discoveries by not following the 
well-trodden path of the mob.&nbsp; However, we moved from the 
serendipitous zone to the WTF zone pretty quickly.&nbsp; The rock anthem
 <i>Stairway to Heaven</i> yielded the song from the original Cinderalla soundtrack <i>A dream is a wish that your heart makes</i> - and the Louis Armstrong classic "Jeepers Creepers".&nbsp; Jeepers Creepers indeed!</p><p></p><p><img src="support_files/zuk3.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p>Music
 similarity is hard, there are many ways to define similarity: genre, 
timbre, structure, mode, instrumentation, style, year, lyrics - all 
contribute to song similarity. It is early days for automatic 
content-based recommendations - of the commercial systems that I've 
looked at ZuKool looks to be one of the better ones - but it will be a 
while before these automated systems match what the human-powered 
systems like Pandora can do. &nbsp; ZuKool Chief Scientist Ian Wilson 
says<br><blockquote><i>Obviously we still have a long way to go and many
 improvements to make.&nbsp; One major improvement coming soon is the 
ability to focus our initial recommendations based on your feedback 
(grading and additions to your songlist) which we have right now but is 
not yet operating to speed. We will also be adding user functions 
(social systems) to make the whole experience more community focused and
 fun.</i><br><i></i></blockquote><br><br>
