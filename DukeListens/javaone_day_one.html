			<h2>JavaOne Day One</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>
JavaOne is just so much fun.&nbsp; The days are filled to the brim with 
fun stuff. It's a programmers paradise.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most 
amazing sites ever is walking into the general session and seeing it 
filled wall-to-wall with Java Programmers.&nbsp; 10s of thousands of 
them - it really is quite incredible.&nbsp; I can't imagine how John 
Gage can appear so relaxed and at ease in front of so many people. I had
 the pleasure of sitting down and chatting with John for a few hours a 
couple of weeks ago - he seemed no different when on stage than he did 
sitting in a small room.&nbsp;  </p><p>One of the hardest things about 
JavaOne is that there are just too many different things going on.&nbsp;
 It is hard to decide where to go.&nbsp; I do server programming, web 
programming and desktop programming - I'm interested in tools, I'm 
interested in new language features, I'm interested in scripting 
languages.&nbsp; There's just too much to chose from.&nbsp; I had a chat
 brief chat with the woman who organizes all of the technical sessions. I
 suggested that they release the audio for all of the talks as a series 
of podcasts.&nbsp; She thought that was a good idea.&nbsp; That would 
keep me busy for a year, listening to all of the various talks.&nbsp; I 
hope they do that.<br> </p><p>&nbsp;Some of the highlights for the day:&nbsp; the afternoon tech session with demos of <a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/">World Wind </a>and
 IRIS.&nbsp; The JavaPosse BOF and Neal Gafter's BOF on Closures. Neal 
did a good job convincing me that closures would be a good and 
simplifying addition to the language. I haven't heard any counter 
arguments yet.</p><p>&nbsp;There's a whole lot of buzz around the JavaFX
 stuff.&nbsp; I must admit I am a bit skeptical - perhaps the marketing 
folks have gotten ahead of themselves a bit.&nbsp; F3 is totally cool 
and worthy of a second look, but I'm not sure if it is ready to be 
positioned next to Flash/Apollo and Silverlight as the next generation 
tool for developing hyper-rich web apps.<br></p><p>In the late 
afternoon, I gave my Search Inside the Music talk.&nbsp; It was well 
attended, and was great fun to give.&nbsp; The audience was totally 
engaged - they chuckled at the right spots, participated in the music 
similarity poll stayed awake even while I explained what a Mel Frequency
 Cepstral Coefficient was. They even interrupted the SITM demo several 
times with applause - that's never happened before.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;At the end of the day we had an unofficial Java Music BOF - a bunch of us who do music and Java went out to dinner.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.davekoelle.com/">David Kolle</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/entry/www.jfugue.org/">(JFugue)</a> and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/geertjan/">Geertjann</a>
 (I really did try to learn how to pronounce his name, but it is just 
not possible for my New England tongue to do so), Matt Warman (he makes a
 guitar tab program that uses JFugue),&nbsp; and Michael Good <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/entry/www.recordare.com/xml.html">(MusicXML)</a> had some spicy Chinese food and good conversations about music and Java. </p><p>It
 is 8AM on Wednesday, time to head over for day 2 - lots of good 
sessions today too - Project Caroline, Effective Java Reloaded,&nbsp; a 
GWT talk,&nbsp; extreme gui makeover,&nbsp; F3, darkstar, wonderland, 
java se media, take 2.&nbsp; It will be a full day. Plus I really want 
to spend some time in the pavillion - I've only had a few moments to 
walk through - my biggest surprise there was seeing the Microsoft booth.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p>
