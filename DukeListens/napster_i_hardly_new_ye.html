				<p>Last.fm has been getting a whole lotta love about yesterday's 
announcement that they would offer free on-demand music 
streaming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Commenters on RJ's blog post seemed <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2008/01/23/free-the-music">downright giddy</a>.&nbsp; Multiple <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2008/01/23/free-the-music">Digg</a> front page stories, the<a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&amp;q=last.fm&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;scoring=d&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=d"> blog-o-sphere all a twitter</a>.&nbsp; People seem genuinely excited about free on-demand tracks at Last.fm. &nbsp;</p><p>Which
 may seem to be a bit puzzling.&nbsp; Napster has offered the exact same
 free, web-based, on-demand music listening.&nbsp; From the<a href="http://www.napster.com/faq/"> Napster FAQ</a>:&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>  You can search our catalog of 3 million songs and stream songs up to 3 times each for FREE.
		After the 3rd free play of any single track,
		you can either purchase the track or become a Napster subscriber.  As a subscriber, you can
		download an unlimited number of full-length songs to your PC.  As a <i>Napster To Go</i> subscriber
		you can transfer those tracks to your compatible portable player without paying per track</i>.&nbsp;
		</p><p>Compare that to the Last.fm announcement: <i>Each track can be played up to 3 times for free before a notice appears
telling you about our upcoming subscription service. The soon-to-be
announced subscription service will give you unlimited plays and some
other useful things.</i></p><p>&nbsp;It's the same deal.&nbsp; So why 
are we so excited about Last.fm offering something that has been 
available for years? For me the difference is clear.&nbsp; Last.fm is 
all about music discovery.&nbsp; They have many (perhaps too many!) ways
 to help me find new music.&nbsp; They have the traditional charts that 
show me what is popular.&nbsp; They recommend music based upon my 
listening behavior (I don't have to manually rate tracks). They do 
clever things with the massive amounts of social tags they've 
collected.&nbsp; They will let me explore my friends listening to help 
me find new music.&nbsp; They make lots of their data available so 
others can try to build new things around the Last.fm listening 
experience.</p><p>To me, Last.fm is like a big music club,&nbsp; where 
there are lots of people who are really interested in music, and where 
there are lots of toys to play with.&nbsp; And now this music club is 
giving us a new toy .... on-demand music.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Napster, on 
the other hand, is like a big hardware store.&nbsp; They probably have 
all of the stuff that I'm looking for, but it is probably not a place 
that I'd want to hang out.&nbsp; </p><p>Music pundits have been 
proclaiming that music subscription services are dead - but I think they
 are wrong.&nbsp; It is just that these subscription services can't keep
 their subscribers because they don't know how to keep the subscribers 
happy.&nbsp; You can't just throw 3 million songs onto the net and leave
 your subscribers to find the music.&nbsp; If you want to keep your 
subscribers, you've got to keep them happy - and the way to do that is 
to surround your millions of tracks with ways to help people explore all
 that music.&nbsp; Last.fm knows how to do this.&nbsp; That's why I am 
excited about Last.fm.<br></p>

<p>If you've ever used free Napster you know how horrible the sound 
quality is.  All tracks sound like 64kbps, at best.  Last.fm is much 
better sounding.</p>


<p>I agree that Last.fm is doing a lot of things right, and Napster has 
had a pretty clumsy run every since it went legit, but I think much of 
the demise of free Napster has to do with poor implementation and user 
experience (I'm including sound quality here).</p>


<p>If you're going to give away free streaming music at low quality, 
don't bother.  You've already crippled your service right out of the 
gate.</p>

<p>You also have to remember that Napster was sued over allowing music. 
 I'm betting that there are lots of people who dread using Napster 
because of the possibility that they might be doing something illegal.  
Still, Kudos for last.fm for finally going the right direction.  Now all
 we need is the research to make the discovery better.</p>
