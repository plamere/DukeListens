			<h2>The sixtyone - a musical adventure</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				At ISMIR, I asked Anthony Volodkin, founder of the Hype Machine what music sites he was excited about. He pointed me to <a href="http://www.thesixtyone.com/?referred_by_username=plamere">thesixtyone</a>. I've been playing with thesixtyone for about a week now and Anthony is right, thesixtyone is really interesting.

The sixtyone is part music discovery site, part social music site, and 
part online game.  On thesixtyone, you listen to music (almost all of it
 by artists you've never heard of).  If you find something you like you 
can 'bump it' - (it's just like digging) - songs or artists that get 
bumped a lot hit the home page, where they get lots of visibility and 
lots of plays (just like Digg). Not only is getting to the front page 
highly rewarding for the artist, it also can be highly rewarding for you
 if you were an early 'bumper' of the track. That's because everything 
that you do on the site can earn you points. Visit the site every day, 
you get points.  Listen to music from 'the rack' (the new bin), you get 
points, bump a song that then gets bumped by lots of others, you earn 
lots of points.  Be the first person to bump a song that ultimately 
makes it to the front page - you get a boatload of points.  As you earn 
points, you go up levels, just like D&amp;D - and the higher your level,
 the more weight your opinion carries - higher level users can bump 
songs multiple times. You also get points for 'achievements' like 'disk 
jockey' if you attract lots of  others to your 'radio station'.

I've really just scratched the surface - there is lots to do at 
thesixtyone - you can spend time looking for undiscovered gems, you can 
listen to the music that is been bumped the most, you can explore the 
'favorites' of other users, you can build playlists, you can
<img src="support_files/_61-5.png" alt="61-5.1.1.png" style="float: right; margin: 5px;" border="0" height="91" width="225">
create your radio station, you can comment on tracks (the comments get 
turned into little popups that sometimes appear when people listen to 
the song) - it really does feel a bit like a D&amp;D game - it is fun to
 notified via a little popup that you've just received some points or 
achieved some goal.  And while you are doing this, you are listening to 
music, of all sorts of genres. The music is mostly good to excellent 
(with some clunkers too).  And there are some big name artists - I've 
listened to NiN, Bjork, Jonathan Coulton and Daft Punk on thesixtyone.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_61-4.png"><img src="support_files/_61-4.png" alt="61-4.png" style="float: right;" border="0" width="300"></a>
thesixtyone developers have done a great job of making the site highly 
interactive. It is very highly polished, and is simply fun to use. The 
music player is integrated perfectly into the site, so no matter what 
you do, the music keeps on playing.  
</p><p>
thesixtyone is a fantastic place for new artists to get their music into
 the ears of listeners since listeners are rewarded for finding and 
bumping the newest music.  My friend, <a href="http://blogs.citytechinc.com/sanderson/">Sten</a>, uploaded some tracks for his band "<a href="http://www.thesixtyone.com/#/hungryfathers/">Hungry Fathers</a>" and within minutes their songs had been listened to by half-a-dozen listeners. That just doesn't happen on Myspace.</p><p>
</p><p>
It has been a long while since I've been excited by a new music site.  
Most 'new' music sites are just variations on the Last.fm theme - 
("Let's build a social community around music!") and there just isn't 
any need to do that anymore, Last.fm does it so well. But thesixtyone is
 really doing something different - they are making it easy, fun and 
rewarding to explore and discover new music.

<p>It's true, the site is very well designed and appeals to both my love
 of leveling up and of uploading original, non-copyrighted material.  
The site "jump starts" the typical cold start problem, as mentioned in 
the post, by rewarding "early bumpers".</p>


<p>Interest did die out relatively quickly though.  It would be nice to 
continue to reward low ranking music since our artistic quality alone 
doesn't seem to be carrying us.</p>

<p>hey paul, i can't express how awesome it was to go through my usual 
rss run only to find a post about the love of my life, thesixtyone.  
i've been a fan of duke listens for a while now and really appreciate 
the unique angle you bring to music, software, and the web.</p>


<p>thanks again to anthony of the hype machine for the sweet shout out.</p>

<p>Paul, I just jumped on last night for the first time and haven't 
really waded in, but this is REALLY fascinating - thanks for the tip!</p>

<p>Hey, Paul, great writeup! Stumbled across thesixtyone only a month 
ago, but am obsessed with it. It took a while to figure out what was 
happening, but to be able to "play" music discovery is a compelling way 
to discover new stuff.</p>


<p>Some recent thesixtyone converts and I have started a site to trade 
tips and talk bumps and favorites (and I've already learned stuff about 
how the site works that I always wondered about!). Join us if you'd 
like!</p>
