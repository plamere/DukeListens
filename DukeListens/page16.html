				In one of the podcasts I listen to, I heard an interview with the guy who writes<a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/"> MarsEdit</a>
 - a blog publishing tool for the mac.  I figured I would try it out. 
This post is written in Mars Edit.  The hookup to blogs.sun.com was 
pretty easy - MarsEdit wasn't able to auto-detect the blogger interface,
 but when I indicated manually that the blog was MetaWebLog compatible -
 it did all the right stuff.

I can insert images using MarsEdit as well.  Here's a picture I took of 
an offline recommender system at a bookstore.

<img src="support_files/_IMG_0138.jpg" alt="IMG_0138.jpg" border="0">

<p> (By the way, this picture shows that even human-based recommender 
systems can get really wonky - this bookstore suggests that if you like 
'Collapse' you may also like "I am Legend" - sure they are books about 
similar topics ... but they seem to me to be about as similar as Bill 
Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and "The Hobbit".)

</p><p>I shall try to use MarsEdit for a few blog posts over the next 
month or so during the trial period to see if it is worth the $30.
</p><p>
Well - after posting here are a few impressions - I was hoping that 
MarsEdit would scale the image properly. Also, I'm surprised that the 
editing is not WYSIWYG - it is back to inserting html tags in the post, 
how last decade.  Perhaps there are some setting that I can change to 
make this work better for me.  So far, I'm not excited enough to part 
with $30

				<p>Next month, a couple of students will arrive at Sun Labs to 
intern over the summer working on aspects of Project Aura and Search 
Inside the Music.&nbsp; The interns always bring energy, new ideas, and 
new music to the labs.&nbsp; It is a fun time for us old stodgy 
researchers and hopefully a fun time for the interns as well.&nbsp; One 
of our summer interns, Will, has already been thinking quite a bit about
 issues around recommendation and has been writing about them in his 
blog.&nbsp; Some good posts:</p><ul><li><a href="http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2008/04/11/blog-recommenders/">Blog Recommenders&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href="http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2008/04/11/trading-songs/">Using exemplars in a music recommender</a></li><li><a href="http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2008/03/13/the-role-of-recommendations/">The Role of Recommendations</a> <br></li><li><a href="http://hoenir.himinbi.org/2008/02/06/why-i-like-musicbrainz/">Why I like MusicBrainz</a></li></ul><p>Back
 in February, when we were interviewing intern candidates (and there 
were many excellent candidates to chose from), my colleague Doug Eck 
(the brains behind the machine learning on Search Inside the Music) 
recommended one of his students for the internship.&nbsp; During the 
hiring process, I mentioned to&nbsp; Doug that the competition was 
pretty stiff - I pointed him to a couple of Will's posts as an example 
of the competition.&nbsp; Well, ever the diligent professor, working 
hard to get his students the best opportunities, 20 minutes later, Doug 
sent me a link to his student's "blog".&nbsp; Here's a screen capture

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Steve and I our giving a talk about Project Aura at 
JavaOne. &nbsp; The talk is at 12:10 PM on Tuesday, May 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
It is a good timeslot (not too late and on the first day), but there are
 lots of excellent talks that occur at the same time.&nbsp; If you come 
to the talk, be sure to say hi.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the talk abstract:&nbsp;</p><p><img src="support_files/hp_spacer.html" height="1" width="2">Project
Aura is an open-source recommendation engine, written in the Java™
programming language, being developed by researchers at Sun Labs.<br>
<br>
Recommendation technology is a key enabler for the next-generation web.
Recommenders will be essential to helping us wade through the huge
volume of content such as news, music, video, blogs, and podcasts.
However, current recommendation technology that relies on the wisdom of
crowds has several drawbacks that can ultimately lead to poor
recommendations.<br>
<br>
Project Aura takes a novel approach to recommendation, avoiding many of
the problems inherent in traditional recommender systems. This session
presents the technology behind Project Aura, along with an analysis of
how well Project Aura performs. It shows how you can use the Project
Aura API to generate high-quality recommendations in your Java
technology-based applications. Finally, it shows the capabilities of
Project Aura by demonstrating Aardvark, a blog recommender built with
Project Aura.

				<p>I've been a very infrequent blogger lately - I've been spending 
every free moment coding - getting ready for the Sun Labs open house - 
our annual labs event where we highlight the work we've done in the last
 year.&nbsp; This week, Steve, Jeff and I get to show what we've been 
working on for the last 6 months or so - Project Aura.</p><p>&nbsp;Project
 Aura is a web-scale, open, hybrid recommendation system that uses 
social data (the wisdom of the crowds) combined with the 'aura' of 
information extracted directly from content or mined from the web to 
make recommendations.&nbsp; By combining content-based methods with 
social methods Project Aura can avoid much of the 'cold start' problems 
that plague traditional collaborative filtering recommenders, while 
providing a way to offer explainable recommendations.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;Project Aura is built on top of <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/caroline/">Project Caroline</a> - a platform for development and delivery of dynamically scalable Internet-based services.</p><p>Here's
 a photo of our demo setup ... you can see a bit of our visualization of
 the recommender, and a poster showing our distributed datastore (and 
steve too!)</p><p><br></p><p><img src="support_files/IMG_0170.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br><br>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>Anyone who has worked with a large music collection knows that 
there are all sorts of difficulties in dealing with the metadata that is
 associated with the music. The data is often wrong, misspelled, or 
missing.&nbsp; Getting the metadata right is a hard problem to solve 
even with common songs&nbsp; (should "Hey Jude!"&nbsp; have an 
exclamation point or not?) or artists (Is it 'Prodigy' or 'The 
Prodigy'?). Some artists however seem to go out of their way to make 
things difficult.&nbsp; Take our friend Aphex Twin - on his album 
Windowlicker, track number two is called:&nbsp;</p><p> "Δ<i>M</i><sub><i>i</i></sub><sup>−1</sup> = −<i>α</i>Σ<sub><i>n</i>=1</sub><sup><i>N</i></sup><i>D</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>[<i>n</i>][Σ<sub><i>j</i>∈C{<i>i</i>}</sub><i>F</i><sub><i>ji</i></sub>[<i>n</i> − 1] + <i>F</i>ext<sub><i>i</i></sub>[[<i>n</i><sup>−1</sup>]]"</p><p>I wondered how some of the various Music 2.0 sites were able to handle this track - here are my findings.</p><p>First, here's the song in the iTunes store - they don't even try to render it <br></p><p><img src="support_files/itunes_aphex.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon.com does a bit better, they don't try to render the mathematical characters, but it is readable:</p><p><img src="./page16_files/amazon_aphex.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">&nbsp;</p><p>iLike falls back on the streetname for the song </p><p>&nbsp;<img src="./page16_files/ilike_aphex.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p><p>Google skips the track completely:</p><p><img src="./page16_files/google_aphex.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p><p>As does All Music:</p><p><img src="./page16_files/amg_aphex.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p><p>There are some that get it right - MusicBrainz for one:</p><p><img src="./page16_files/musicbrainz_aphex.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p><p>Our
 Search Inside the Music research database (curated by Doug Eck) gets it
 right too, no surprise since we resolve our music against musicbrainz:</p><p><img src="support_files/sitm_aphex.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br>&nbsp;As does last.fm (I think they resolve against MusicBrainz too):</p><p><img src="./page16_files/lastfm_aphex.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></p><p>Spotify gets it right too:</p><p><img src="./page16_files/spotify_aphex.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So
 it looks like about 1/3 of the sites got it right, and those are the 
ones that are using MusicBrainz to clean up their Metadata.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This is one of the many reasons why I really like MusicBrainz .</p><p> <br>And by the way, this track is also noted for the fact that Aphex Twin has embedded his image in the audio.&nbsp; An <a href="http://www.bastwood.com/aphex.php">FFT of the track reveals his mug</a><br>&nbsp;</p>

I visited the iTunes music store this weekened. &nbsp; I was surprised 
to see that Jeff Buckley's Hallelujah was the number one song.&nbsp; 
That certainly was curious since the song has been around for over <strike>14</strike>
 24 years and Jeff has been gone for over 10.&nbsp; This morning I 
visited Amazonmp3 - and there I saw Jeff Buckley's Hallelujah at 
#3.&nbsp; Wtf?&nbsp; Why was a 14 year old <strike>song</strike> 
recording suddenly at the top of the charts?&nbsp; A quick blog search 
gave the answer.&nbsp; American Idol contestant (and next teen heart 
throb, dreads and all) Jason Castro sang "Hallelujah''&nbsp;  last 
week.&nbsp; Jason almost seemed to be channeling Buckley with his 
ethereal singing voice.&nbsp; American Idol judges Randy and Simon both 
stated that the Jeff Buckley version of that song was one of their all 
time favorite songs.&nbsp; No doubt these comments drove thousands of 
idol viewers to iTunes and Amazon to check out Jeff Buckley's version of
 the song.&nbsp; I am amazed that this little television moment had such
 an effect on the charts.&nbsp; It is a good song .. and Jason does a 
pretty good 2 minute version of the song.<br></p><p>Here's the moment, captured on YouTube.</p><p><br></p><object height="355" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/z2nRxKC-OyA"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="support_files/z2nRxKC-OyA.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="355" width="425"></object>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>This week&nbsp; I zip up to Toronto to take part in a Canadian 
Music Week panel called 'Recommendation Engines: The ubersolution to 
Managing Music Ultra Surplus'.&nbsp; They've put together a great set of
 panelists:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.cmw.net/cmw2008/conference_speaker_bio.asp?speaker_ID=824&amp;panel_ID=226">Sandy Pearlman</a> - <i>Visiting Scholar,</i><b> McGill University</b>, Montreal, QC</li><li><a href="http://www.cmw.net/cmw2008/conference_speaker_bio.asp?speaker_ID=1210&amp;panel_ID=226">Michael McGuire</a> - <i>Research VP,</i><b> Gartner G2 Media Group</b>, San Jose, CA<a href="http://www.cmw.net/cmw2008/conference_speaker_bio.asp?speaker_ID=1228&amp;panel_ID=226"></a></li><li><a href="http://www.cmw.net/cmw2008/conference_speaker_bio.asp?speaker_ID=1228&amp;panel_ID=226">Tom Conrad</a> - <i>Chief Technology,</i><b> Pandora Media Inc</b>, Oakland<a href="http://www.cmw.net/cmw2008/conference_speaker_bio.asp?speaker_ID=1113&amp;panel_ID=226"></a></li><li><a href="http://www.cmw.net/cmw2008/conference_speaker_bio.asp?speaker_ID=1113&amp;panel_ID=226">Robert Gjerdingen</a> - <i>Professor,</i><b> Northwestern</b>, Evanston</li><li><a href="http://www.cmw.net/cmw2008/conference_speaker_bio.asp?speaker_ID=1114&amp;panel_ID=226">Paul Lamere</a> - <i>Principle Investigator,</i><b> Sun Microsystems</b>,<br></li></ul><p>The
 only panelist that I've not met is Dr. Gjerdingen - but I am looking 
forward to meeting him.&nbsp; He's the co-author of one of the most 
cited studies in the Music Information Retrieval academic community that
 looked at how well humans can classify music into music genres.&nbsp; 
Just about every paper on machine classification of music cites this 
study.</p><p>&nbsp;Here's the panel abstract:</p><blockquote><p><i><span class="panelbody">New music discovery will be unlike anything any
generation has ever experienced. As more music becomes available online
and the long tail gets longer, recommendation engines with improved
search filters are going to play a more important role in online
commerce. With an aggregate of over one billion song versions now
available somewhere online (according to Cache Logic), implementing
recommendation engineering navigation for this functionally infinite
database seems absolutely necessary. This panel features experts who'll
bring you up to date on the latest discovery and recommendation news on
what would otherwise prove an ungraspable chaos of music overload.</span></i></p></blockquote><p>The
 panel is on Thursday at 2:40 in the Manitoba room of the&nbsp; Royal 
York hotel in Toronto.&nbsp; Be sure to stop by and say hello if you 
attend.<br></p>

				<p>
It is hard to evaluate music recommendation systems. Current evaluation 
techniques will often use web mining for artist co-occurrence on web 
pages or playlists as a way to infer artist similarity to compare 
against a recommender, or will try to predict a a set of ratings (1 star
 or 4 star) such as we see with the <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/">Netflix prize</a>.&nbsp;
 However, these types of evaluations generally don't measure several 
aspects that are associated with a good recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
instance,&nbsp; evaluations that measure how well a recommender system 
can predict how a user will rate songs are tested against songs that the
 user has already rated.&nbsp; This penalizes recommenders that generate
 good but novel recommendations.&nbsp; Since the user hasn't rated these
 novel recommendations yet (since they are novel), the recommender 
doesn't receive any credit for the recommendations.&nbsp; A good 
recommender should recommend novel items, but most recommender 
evaluations don't evaluate this aspect of recommendation at all.&nbsp; A
 recommender that tells you that if you like 'The Beatles' you might 
like 'The Rolling Stones' may be accurate, and may be evaluated highly, 
but it is not a great recommender if all it tells you about are artists 
that you all ready know about.</p><p>Probably the best way to evaluate 
recommenders are with user studies.&nbsp; Simply ask people how they 
like they recommendations to rate the recommendations.&nbsp; However 
this can skewed results as well.&nbsp; People will tend to rate 
recommendations that include many familiar relevant items as better than
 recommendations that contain a number of unfamiliar items.&nbsp; Since 
it can take a good deal of time to evaluate a recommended item (such as a
 song, artist, movie or book), it is hard to get accurate evaluations 
for recommendations that contain large numbers of unfamiliar items.</p><p>My <a href="http://mtg.upf.edu/%7Eocelma/MusicRecommendationTutorial-ISMIR2007/">co-tutorist</a>, <a href="http://mtg.upf.edu/%7Eocelma/">Oscar Celma</a>
 has created a personalized survey for evaluating a number of different 
types of music recommendation.&nbsp; Unlike previous evaluations, 
Oscar's survey recognizes the importance of novel recommendations.&nbsp;
 The survey will offer you a number of&nbsp; music recommendations 
(based upon your last.fm listening behavior) and ask you questions about
 the recommendations, including whether or not you've heard the artist 
or the track before, and to what degree do you like the 
music.&nbsp;&nbsp; With this evaluation Oscar can learn which 
recommenders tend to recommend familiar music, which recommend novel 
music - as well as which recommenders are recommending relevant music 
(that is, music that the user will like to listen to).</p><p>Oscar has 
done a good job designing the survey - you can evaluate as many or as 
few recommendations as you'd like.&nbsp; The more participants in the 
survey, the better the results, so I encourage all of my readers to take
 the survey.&nbsp; As a reward, tt the end of it all, you may get a few 
novel recommendations from a state-of-the-art music recommender to 
expand your music horizons.</p><p>Take<a href="http://foafdevel.searchsounds.net/survey/index.html"> Oscar Celma's Music Recommendation Survey</a><br></p>

				<p>Yesterday was the first (hopefully of many) SanFran Music Tech 
Summit.&nbsp; This was a gathering of musicians, producers, lawyers, 
radio heads, and technologists.&nbsp; The summit was held at the Kabuki 
Hotel in Japan Town.&nbsp; Kudos to Brian Zisk and the rest of the 
organizers for putting this all together.&nbsp; <br> </p><p>I was lucky 
enough to get to moderate a panel on recommendation and discovery.&nbsp;
 The panelists included two technologists that build automated 
recommendation systems (<a href="http://www.matchmine.com/about/team/mtroiano.php" target="blank">Michael Troiano</a> - matchmine, CEO and <a href="http://doublev3.com/" target="blank">Benjamin Masse</a> - Double V3) and two human recommender systems:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/" target="blank">Bill Goldsmith</a> - Radio Paradise, Founder/Coder and <a href="http://www.balanceskillz.com/" target="blank">Balance</a>
 - Main Urban Buyer, Rasputin Music.&nbsp; I thought this was a great 
mix of panelists.&nbsp; The human recommenders have a real understanding
 of what it takes to engage their audience.&nbsp; Those of us who are 
trying to build automated recommenders can learn a great deal from these
 guys.&nbsp; The panel talked about the characteristics of a good music 
recommendation.&nbsp; Some of the observations:</p><p>Building trust is 
extremely important - for human-based recommenders, this trust is built 
up over a long period of time.&nbsp; Bill talked about how his listeners
 over a period of days and weeks grow to trust his taste in music - they
 know Bill won't lead them too far astray. Similarly, Balance interacts 
with his customers on a weekly basis, building a relationship over a 
many weeks and months.&nbsp; Contrast that with automated systems, 
Benjamin suggests that they only have 30 seconds or so to gain some 
level of trust with a web user before the user is ready to click onto 
another page.&nbsp; </p><p>Bill talked about the ''Tyranny of the 
Bored'' - where the opinion of people who have nothing to do all day but
 browse the web, digg stories, tag music, and write reviews have an 
inordinate amount influence on our taste.&nbsp; The taste and opinions 
of busy people, those that don't have time to spend on the social webs 
is not counted.<br></p><p>They've recorded the panels and have put them online.&nbsp; The recommendation&nbsp; panel is here:

				<p>The west coast Sun Labs offers a weekly speaker series called 
'Intellectual Desserts' where internal and external speakers present 
talks on an eclectic series of topics&nbsp; - mostly 
technical.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I am headed out to the west coast lab next 
week I figured it would be a good time to give a talk about our new 
project, so I signed up for the Intellectual Desserts.</p><p>It was not 
until after a signed up for the talk that I looked closely at the 
speaker schedule. Last week's Intellectual Desserts speaker was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth">Don Knuth</a>.&nbsp; This week the speaker is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sutherland">Ivan Sutherland.</a>
 Both Don and Ivan are computer luminaries and Turing award winners - 
both have had an incredible impact on computer science - they are living
 legends.&nbsp; Yes, I am intimidated.&nbsp; But such is the life in Sun
 Labs - it is great to be surrounded by so many smart people.<br></p>
