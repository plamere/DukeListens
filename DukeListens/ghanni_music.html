				<p><a href="http://www.ghannimusic.com/">Ghanni music</a> is a 
content-based music recommender.&nbsp; Type in the name of an artist or a
 song, and you get recommendations based on music that sounds similar to
 that song or artist.&nbsp; According to their FAQ, Ghanni&nbsp; uses "<em>advanced pattern recognition and music signal analysis
techniques to estimate the similarities between your query and the
songs in our database. The similarity is a function of the rhythm,
timbre, instrumentation, vocals, and the music surface information we
automatically extract from a song</em>."</p><p>The web interface to 
Ghanni, unlike the latest round of social music recommenders,&nbsp; is 
focused totally on music recommendation. There are no friends, 
playlists, charts, games, users profiles or any of the seemingly 
standard features of a Music 2.0 site,&nbsp; just recommendations.</p><p><img src="support_files/ghanni.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="95%">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Ghanni actually gives you 3 types of recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>Song level recommendation</strong>s - this is something that a content-based site like Ghanni can in theory, do better than a social system,</li><li><strong>Think about artists</strong> - these are similar artists</li><li><strong>Playlist within the same atmosphere</strong></li></ul><p><strong>The Recommendations</strong></p><p>
 So how are the Ghanni recommendations?&nbsp; I found them to be rather 
curious.&nbsp; I've worked with enough content-based recommenders to 
know what to expect.&nbsp; Content-based recommenders will often 
recommend music by different artists, different genres and era.&nbsp; 
Content-based recommenders will do things like put&nbsp; Eleanor Rigby 
closer to a string quartet than to Helter Skelter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 
unlike social recommenders, content-based recommenders don't care about 
popularity, content-based recommendations will tend to include many more
 unknown artists than a social recommender. </p><p>The curious thing 
about Ghanni is that their recommendations seemed more like social 
recommendations than content-based recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I 
started with the song 'Hey Jude' by the Beatles.&nbsp; Recommendations 
received were 'Surfer Girl' by the Beach Boys, 'Dear Prudence' by the 
Beatles,&nbsp; 'Laughter in the Rain' by Neil Sedaka, 'Tangerine' by Led
 Zeppelin, and 'Fight for your honor' by Chicago.&nbsp; All classic rock
 from the same era by very popular artists.</p><p>Next up, I tried a 
song by 'Clap your hands say yeah' called 'Is this Love?'.&nbsp; I 
received recommendations for songs by Razorlight, Catatonia, Rilo Kiley,
 Stellstarr, and Bloc Party.&nbsp; All indie artists that have been 
popular in the last 5 years or so.</p><p>Final test - '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_9">Revolution #9</a>'
 by the Beatles.&nbsp; This song is so unlike any other song by the 
Beatles, or for that matter any other pop song released during the 60s 
or 70s. I'd expect recommendations for songs by artists such as&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen" title="Karlheinz Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage" title="John Cage">John Cage</a>.&nbsp; Instead, Ghanni gives me more Beatles, Ike and Tina Turner, Bo Diddley, and Tom McRae.&nbsp; Not a single example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te">Music Concrete</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 When I ask for a playlist within the same atmosphere, it looks like 
playlist from the latest classic rock radio station: Beatles, Led 
Zeppelin, Cream, Eagles, Doors, Ike and Tina.</p><p><em>Update: </em>Oscar points out that if you ask for <a href="http://www.ghannimusic.com/ghanni-music-selection.php?id=70216">recommendations related to a French song</a>,
 all of the recommendations are&nbsp; French songs.&nbsp; Although very 
desirable, this type of recommendation is far beyond the 
state-of-the-art for content-based recommendations.<br></p><p>So what is
 going on here? These don't seemed to be content-based recommendations 
at all!&nbsp; Are they trying to pull the wool over our eyes? My guess 
is that the scientists at Ghanni decided to use all data that was 
available to them to build their similarity models. So in addition to 
their content-based features related to timbre, pitch and tempo, they 
are including features that are typically found in a song's metadata. 
This include&nbsp; the year of release and the genre of the song.&nbsp; 
This is a perfectly reasonable thing to do, any machine learning 
scientist will tell you to use all of the data that you can.&nbsp; 
However, it appears that these features derived from the metadata are 
overwhelming the content based features.&nbsp; The resulting 
recommendations lack the 'aha' factor that come with content-based 
recommenders.&nbsp; There are no surprise linkages across genres. Just 
rather pedestrian recommendations that you could easily get from the All
 Music guide.</p><p>Ghanni seems to have some <a href="http://www.ghannimusic.com/ghanni-music-about1.php?an=3">smart people</a>
 on their team, so we can expect them to improve their recommendations. 
But for&nbsp; right now, the recommendations don't seem to be any better
 than what you could get from the many other music recommenders that are
 out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Thanks yet again&nbsp; for the tip, Oscar!</em><br></p><p><br></p>

                Nice analysis! :-)

Btw, how does Oscar always come up with these cool sites?

I also gave it a quick try. I mainly used Jack Johnson and Ani DiFranco 
as queries. Some of the recommendation results look similar to 
content-based results I've seen... 
However, the list of similar artists does seems to use (at least some) 
non audio based information.

            <div class="comment even" id="comment2">

                The examples: 
<ul>
<li>The Beatles, Revolution #9 <a href="http://www.ghannimusic.com/ghanni-music-selection.php?id=32803" rel="nofollow">example</a>.</li>
<li>Some (content-based?) music based on <a href="http://www.ghannimusic.com/ghanni-music-selection.php?id=69557" rel="nofollow">Madeleine (Jaques Brel)</a>. Only French artists! well done CB-recommender :-)
</li>
</ul>

<p>So, it is clear that, at least, they do some 
filtering/reordering/tweaking after the content-based proposed songs. Or
 maybe merging two approaches: CB plus editorial metadata. Who knows?
<br>
But then, is not a CB recommender but a Hybrid one.
