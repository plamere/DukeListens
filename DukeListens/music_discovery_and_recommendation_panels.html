 to see what talks and panels I could find about music recommendation.  I
 found a number of interesting talks that were related to music 
recommendation, but none that seemed to answer the question about why 
music recommendation seems so broken and what is going to be done to fix
 it.  Since I know a bit about the topic, I decided that perhaps I 
should propose such a talk.  But I found out that I'm way too late ... 
the SXSW proposal deadline was July 11.  However, the SXSW organizer 
that I contacted said that there is still a very small chance that if I 
submitted something that it could be accepted. He indicated that 
although the voting on submissions is closed, that if my proposal <em>received some favorable comments</em>, that would help. So although it is a long shot, I decided it wouldn't hurt to submit something, so here's my proposal:
<ul>
<p>
 <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2146?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fq%3Amusic+recommendation"> I'm so sad, my iPod thinks I'm Emo.</a>
 - Music recommendation is broken - automatic music recommenders make 
mistakes that no human would ever make. In this talk, we will explore 
why recommenders make such dumb mistakes and we will explore some of the
 new ideas coming from recommendation and music researchers to help make
 music recommendations better.
</p></ul>
<p>
If you think it is interesting and may be something you'd attend at SXSW, I'd be pleased if you'd <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2146?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fq%3Amusic+recommendation">add a comment</a> to the proposal.
</p><p>
Here is a list of other SXSW panel proposals that are somewhat related 
to either music discovery or recommendation.  It looks to me like the 
most closely related panel is <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1118?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fdescription%3Amusic%2Fcategory%3ANew+Technology+%5Eslash%5E+Next+Generation">Music 2.0 = Music Discovery Chaos?</a>. This one does look interesting and I'd love to attend it, although I don't think it is going to be too research-oriented.
</p><ul>
  <li>  <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2146?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fq%3Amusic+recommendation"> I'm so sad, my iPod thinks I'm Emo.</a>
 - Music recommendation is broken - automatic music recommenders make 
mistakes that no human would ever make. In this talk, we will explore 
why recommenders make such dumb mistakes and we will explore some of the

</li><li> <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1973?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fcompany%3Alast.fm">Keeping it Human in the Age of Big Data</a>"The
 selection and placement of stories on this page were determined 
automatically by a computer program." - http://news.google.com Or was 
it? At Last.fm we've grappled with how to present and filter our 
user-generated music data, but also how to mix in true editorial 
content. Humanizing core features was much of the impetus for the recent
 re-launch.
</li><li> <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1118?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fdescription%3Amusic%2Fcategory%3ANew+Technology+%5Eslash%5E+Next+Generation">Music 2.0 = Music Discovery Chaos?</a>The
 way we discover music has entirely changed in less than 10 years. 
Radio’s aging demo is presented with safe mainstream offerings. Music 
discovery is at the forefront of technology and social networks, yet no 
new standard has successfully been adopted. Websites abound attempt at 
both data and user generated rating/filter systems. Human VS algorithm: 
what method can save us?
</li><li> <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1129?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fdescription%3Amusic%2Fcategory%3ANew+Technology+%5Eslash%5E+Next+Generation">Neither Fish Nor Flesh: Music Discovery Going Semantic</a>
 - Current music discovery techniques rely on human annotation and human
 behaviour to generate recommendations. We review current recommendation
 methods and take a in-depth look at new semantic recommendation 
methods, and discuss how both worlds can be combined to deliver an 
ultimately better music discovery experience.
</li><li> <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1442?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fdescription%3Amusic%2Fcategory%3ANew+Technology+%5Eslash%5E+Next+Generation">“Just For You”… Really?</a>
 - Personalization technologies are all over the web now, with 
applications everywhere offering recommendations for movies, music, 
video, blogs and most anything else we might like online. Do any of 
these systems work, and if so how? Is “Discovery” the next “Search,” or 
just an excuse for behavioral targeting systems that compromise privacy?
 Finally… If you’re a site publisher interested in adding personalized 
recommendations, how do you pick a partner to help you get there, or 
strike out on your own and get the feature built????
</li><li> <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1540?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fdescription%3Arecommendation">Collaborative Filters: The Evolution of Recommendation Engines</a>
 - 
    Recommendation engines have boomed in the era of social media. These
 panelists are experts at collaborative filtering systems. Citing Digg, 
Amazon, and Netflix as examples, they will have a high level discussion 
about the evolution of recommendation engines and how each approach is 
different. 
</li><li> <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/1444?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fdescription%3Arecommendation">People Who Purchased This Also Purchased… What??</a>
 - Ever wonder how sites determine what music and movies to recommend? 
Ever received an off-beat recommendation that made you go hmm….? That’s 
because most sites use collaborative filtering – which determines 
recommendations based on what other users like. This panel will discuss 
how these technologies are evolving and the future of recommendations.
</li><li> <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/2039?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F3%2Fdescription%3Arecommendation">Algorithms, Meta-Data, and Why the Future is Behavioral</a>
 - Data about data or data with data? Social smarts versus machine 
smarts? Recommendation engines are finally delivering on helping us 
filter infinite choices while user generated ratings and reviews can now
 be found on almost any product or service. Where are these being 
combined to help users and what's next?

<p>Noticed your comments a few times on the Pho List.</p>


<p>Finally decided to visit your blog after seeing the mention of Spotify.</p>


<p>Offered a panel for SXSW Interactive on the topic of going 'From Consumed to Thrifty', still waiting for the verdict.</p>
