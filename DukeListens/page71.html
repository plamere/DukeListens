targeted at the J2ME platform (CLDC in particular).  This week the 
expert group released the first community draft of the specification for
 community review.  This is a significant step for the group and the

One of the really nice benefits of working at Sun is their flexible 
office and work from home programs.  I've been working from home now for
 a couple of years.  I go into the office just one day a week.  Its 
great for my productivity, and for my family life too, I get to see the 
kids before and after school, and I save lots of time normally spent 
sitting on route 3. Of course, sitting behind a computer day in and day 
out isn't exactly great for my physique (not that programmers are 
supposed to care ..), so I've taken up walking on a daily basis.  I've 
been walking about 9 miles a day.  Today was a milestone day, I managed 
to go the whole day without driving anywhere.  Since Sunday I've driven 
exactly 7 miles and have walked 27 miles ... alas tomorrow is my day to 
drive into Burlington ... so that will be 50 miles of driving just in 
one day. Ah well...

	<div class="entry-content">
				When the PC first came out back in the early 80s they had very 
primitive sound capabilities. They could beep and click and nothing 
else.  One very small company started shipping a sound card (called 
SoundBlaster) that you could plug into one of your free slots on our PC.
  There wasn't much you could do with it at first, but then slowly, some
 games started to take advantage of the card.  The gaming experience 
with 'high' quality sound was much improved, and soon the gamers started
 to buy the card.  A few years later, the sound card had trickled down 
from the gamer's PC to the standard office PC. Now every PC now has high
 quality sound, thanks to the gamers.  
<p>
A dozen years ago, when the gamers were playing Doom, a small company 
called 3dfx  introduced  a hardware accelerator for 3d graphics.  As 
with sound there was not much that you could do with such a beast but 
play games like Quake.  Again, the gaming experience with a 3D 
accelerator was much improved, the gamers bought them in droves.  Now, 
every PC comes with a 3D accelerator.  We are starting to see 3D 
graphics move out of the gaming world and onto the desktop.  Witness <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/looking_glass/demo.html"> Looking Glass, a 3D desktop </a> (written in Java no less).  
</p><p>
Now, we are starting to see the gamers toy with speech technology. One of the latest 3D shooters, <a href="http://www.beyondunreal.com/content/articles/74_1.php">Unreal Tournament 2004</a>
 uses speech recognition technology to allow the player to control their
 'bot team mates.  It relies on the Microsoft speech sdk (a free 
download).  
</p><p>
Time will tell whether the gamers will find that speech enhances the 
gaming experience enough so that it becomes ubiquitous, but if it does, 
it may be the push that speech needs to get it accepted into the wider 
world of the desktop.
 Follow the gamers.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>
In <a href="http://jnn.dev.java.net/"> JNN (The Juicy News Network) </a>,
 FreeTTS announces new articles on various news feeds. As with most 
things on the web, news feeds are not always named with words that are 
found in the dictionary. In my current set of feeds, I have words like 
slashdot, javapedia, MacRumors, eJournal, salon.com. None of these words
 are in the FreeTTS lexicon. Furthermore, FreeTTS will look up words 
after tokenization, so text like 'salon.com' gets turned into 'salon 
com' ... there is no more 'dot' in '.com'.
</p><p>
Certainly, it would be helpful if an application could easily extend the
 lexicon of FreeTTS. FreeTTS does have a lexicon called the addenda that
 is for this, but, unfortunately, it is somewhat buried, and hard to use
 it that way. So to fix up the JNN pronunciations, I had to write a 
little function that would filter the text and fix up the 
pronunciations.
</p><p>
To do this I used the java.util.regex package to search and fixup the 
text. It is incredibly easy to use and quite powerful. For instance here
 are some code snippets:
</p><p>
Here's a snippet that turns 'salon.com' to 'salon dot com'.

</p><pre>private static Pattern dotComPattern = Pattern.compile("(\\S)\\.(\\S)");
description = dotComPattern.matcher(description).replaceAll("$1 dot $2");
</pre>

Here's a snippet that replaces wiki words with space separated words. TheOneRing would become The One Ring. Another two liner:

<pre>private static Pattern wikiPattern =    Pattern.compile("([a-z])([A-Z])");
m = wikiPattern.matcher(description).replaceAll("$1 $2");
</pre>
<p>

Finally, in a bit of irony, FreeTTS can't pronounce its own name, so I fix that up to turning it into 'free TTS' .
</p><p>
With this set of changes, JNN is reading and announcing articles with 
much more understandable pronunciations, It's tongue is less tied. 
Still, it would be better to have a more systematic method of addressing
 such unusual pronunciations. Two possiblities: a user editable lexicon,
 or annotating rss feeds with pronunciation information.

You can check out this code in the <a href="https://jnn.dev.java.net/source/browse/jnn/com/sun/tools/jnn/RSSAnnouncer.java?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup"> RSSAnnouncer.java </a> - part of JNN code repository.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				My son likes to play a game called NeverWinter Nights on my laptop 
(a windows XP system from Dell).   Every so often, while he's playing, 
something goes awry: the game freezes, the computer locks up, and the 
only recourse is to power off the machine and power it back up again.  
I'd say the average uptime for this machine is 6 hours, but hey -- its a
 laptop,  you are supposed to shut it down to save batteries aren't you?
 
<p>
My desktop home machine is a generic linux box.  Its average uptime is 
about 30 days or so.  The last time I brought it down was to upgrade the
 video card.  Power glitches account for most of the reboots.  I can't 
recall a time when I had to reboot the system to unwedge it. 
</p><p>
When working on <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4">Sphinx-4</a>,
 I work primary on an UltraSparc III system called 'glottis'.  We 
received this system on April 8th, 2003.  Here is the complete history 
of system reboots:
</p><p>
</p><pre><a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2e5e424f434b5c4b6e4942415a5a475d">[email&#160;protected]</a>% last reboot
reboot    system boot                   Wed Apr  9 07:39 
reboot    system boot                   Wed Apr  9 06:35 
reboot    system boot                   Wed Apr  9 06:31 
reboot    system boot                   Tue Apr  8 17:05 
</pre>
<p>
That's April 9th <b>2003</b>. This system has been running for nearly 
400 days, and in fact has only been rebooted 4 times in its entire 
lifetime! This system was taken out of its shipping box,  plugged into 
the UPS, powered on, a couple of OS patches were applied, and that was 
that.  It just runs and runs.  
</p><p>
Netcraft keeps tabs on the top 50  <a href="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/today/top.avg.html"> sites with the longest uptime</a>. Amazingly enough <b>all</b>
 of the top 50 systems are BSD or FreeBSD systems. The top five systems 
have all been running for 5 years straight!  One may well wonder why 
there are no Solaris and Linux boxes in the top 50.  According to the <a href="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/accuracy.html#whichos">NetCraft FAQ</a>:
<i>HP-UX, Linux, NetApp NetCache, Solaris and recent releases of FreeBSD
 cycle back to zero after 497 days, exactly as if the machine had been 
rebooted at that precise point. Thus it is not possible to see a HP-UX, 
Linux or Solaris system with an uptime measurement above 497 days.
</i> That's an unfortunate bug, I bet we'd see many Solaris and Linux boxes in the top 50.
</p><p>
It would really be great if all my computers could have uptimes measured
 in years not in hours.  I wince every time I hear the sound of disks 
being abruptly powered down when my son hits the power-off button on the
 laptop. That's just not right.  Well, apparently, there is a version of
 NeverWinter nights for Linux. Maybe it is time to put the <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/javadesktopsystem/">Java Desktop System</a> on the laptop.

				Actors keep track of how far removed they are from Kevin Bacon (<a href="http://www.louisville.com/loumag/mar/bacon.htm">Six degrees of Kevin Bacon)</a>, and mathematicians keep track of their <a href="http://personalwebs.oakland.edu/%7Egrossman/erdoshp.html"> Erdos Number </a> which represents their distance from mathematician Paul Erdos. 
<p>
 It seems only natural that Java programmers should keep track of their <b> JagNumber</b>.
  A programmer's JagNumber represents their distance from the father of 
Java - James A. Gosling.  James' JagNumber is zero. He is the only 
person with a JagNumber of zero.  Anyone who has collaborated with James
 on a Java project has a JagNumber of 1.  People  who have written code 
with someone with a JagNumber 1 have a JagNumber 2, and so on.
</p><p>
Last month I spent a few hours over a weekend and added FreeTTS support to <a href="http://jnn.dev.java.net/"> The Juicy News Network (JNN) </a>
  an RSS client written in Java by none another than James Gosling.  
This two day collaboration gives me a JagNumber of one! woohoo! That's 
as low as I can go. 
</p><p>
If you are looking to lower your own JagNumber take a look at the <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/">FreeTTS </a> project or the <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4"> Sphinx-4 </a>
 project. If have some code to contribute to these open source speech 
engines you can lower your JagNumber to two.  Imagine the bragging 
rights at the local pub.

				I've collected some more performance data for <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4">Sphinx-4</a>
  In particular, I've been comparing our Sphinx-4 performance against 
Sphinx 3.3 (the fast, large vocabulary recongizer written in C). One 
thing that is great about working on speech recognition systems is that 
they are pretty easy to compare.  I just have to compare the accuracy 
(expressed as a word error rate - <b>WER</b>) and the speed expressed in terms of  real time (<b>RT</b>).  For both of these metrics, lower is better.  This table - <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmusphinx/twiki/view/Sphinx4/ThreeDotThreeVsFour">Sphinx 3.3 vs. Sphinx 4 Performance</a>
 shows how well Sphinx-4 performs compared to Sphinx 3.3 for a wide 
range of vocabularies (from very small with 11 words, to very large with
 60,000 words).
<p>
This table shows that for all tests except for the very large vocabulary
  test (hub4) we are running faster and more accurate than Sphinx 3.3.  
We are still working on improving the large vocabulary performance .. we
 are almost there.

				<span>
    One of my primary tasks right now is improving the speed of the <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx-4" shape="rect">Sphinx-4</a> 
    recognizer. There are three battle-lines in this war on slowness: 
    improving algorithms, improving application tuning, and optimizing the 
    code. One of my primary tools in the war is <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/jfluid/" shape="rect">Jfluid 
    </a>, a Java application profiler developed by the folks at Sun's research 
    lab. JFluid works differently from other profilers ... instead of sampling 
    your application periodically to find out where time is being spent, it 
    instruments the byte codes. This has a number of advantages. First of all, 
    the profiling results are exact, not approximate. Due to the vagaries of 
    sampling, other profilers are apt to miss calls to some methods entirely. 
    Since JFluid instruments the byte codes, it never misses a thing. If 
    Jfluid says that a method has been called 1,232,123 times, you know that 
    it really was. JFluid also lets you select a narrow subset of your 
    application to profile. For instance, the typical recognition inner loop 
    looks like this:

    </span>
<pre><span>    while (!done) {
       scorePaths();
       prunePaths();
       growPaths();
    }</span>
</pre>
<span>
    with a substantial fraction of the work taking place in growPaths(). With 
    JFluid, you can turn on profiling for growPaths() and every method that is 
    called (directly or indirectly) from growPaths() while leaving profiling 
    off for scorePaths() and prunePaths(). Other profilers I've used require 
    you to turn profiling on for the whole application which results in my 
    having to wait much longer for answers as the profiler wastes time 
    collecting data on scorePaths() and prunePaths().

    </span>
<p>
<span>
      JFluid is one of the best kept Java secrets. If you are working to 
      improve your application's performance I highly recommend giving JFluid 
      a try.

    Now that we have the first post out of the way, lets get right down to 
    business. First, who am I? I am a member of the Sun's research lab. I am 
    part of the speech team where we spend our time looking at issues relating 
    to speech synthesis and speech recognition.

    </span>
<p>
<span>
      Most recently the speech team has been creating speech engines written 
      entirely in the Java(TM) programming language. First, there is <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/" shape="rect">FreeTTS 
      </a>a speech synthesis engine written in Java, and there is <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4" shape="rect">Sphinx-4</a> 
      - a speech recognition engine written in Java. Both of these engines 
      have been released as open source under a BSD style license at 
      SourceForge. FreeTTS has been available for a few years now, and is in 
      use on a number of projects. We are moving toward an official Sphinx-4 
      release RSN.
    </span>
</p>
<span>
    
</span>
<p>
<span>
      In this blog I hope to keep track of some of the issues involved in 
      writing on speech engines. Some issues that I'll probably touch on from 
      time to time are:
    </span>
</p>
<span>
    
</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>
        Java performance
      </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>
        Improving accuracy of a recognizer
      </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>
        Open source development techniques
      </span>
</li>
</ul>
<span>
    One of the most often questions I am asked about our work with Java Speech 
    engines is <i>Isn't Java too slow to meet the high performance 
    requirements of speech?</i> The short answer, is (of course) no. The long 
    answer can be found in the whte paper <a href="http://www.sunlabs.com/techrep/2002/abstract-114.html" shape="rect">FreeTTS 
    - A Performance Case Study</a>.
