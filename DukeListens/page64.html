				<p>
This week, <a href="http://research.sun.com/">research.sun.com</a> is profiling (pun intended) <a href="http://research.sun.com/spotlight/2004-10-11_jfluid.html">   Misha Dmitriev</a>, the project lead for <a href="http://profiler.netbeans.org/">JFluid</a>, the Java profiler. <b>JFluid</b>
 is one of my favorite Java tools.  It will profile a Java application 
without the usual inaccuracies. JFluid uses a modified JVM that can add 
instrumentation to your class files when you wish to profile them. This 
allows you to easily enable and disable profiling on a method by method 
basis, thus avoiding the usual problems with some profilers that vastly 
slow down the execution of your program.  JFluid directly instruments 
your methods instead of relying on sampling (like most other profilers 
do).  Sampling profilers are about as accurate as the current <a href="http://electoral-vote.com/">presidential polls</a>.
 Since they only take  periodic samples of your application, sampling 
profilers are likely to misrepresent the overall profile. By directly 
adding instrumentation to your classes, JFluid can give you a 100% 
accurate representation of where your program is spending its time.
</p><p>
<b>Jfluid</b> is being incorporated into the next version of <a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>. There's a good overview of JFluid at JDJ here: <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=45081">JFluid: A New Way to Profile Java Applications</a>

Yes, I know <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond">Hinkmond</a> is supposed to do all of the wireless stories, but I haven't seen him mention this one. Curitel has has just released <a href="http://www.mobilemag.com/content/100/340/C3263/"> this two Megapixel TTS Phone</a>
 in Korea that has speech synthesis built into it. The idea is that when
 you receive text message, not only can you read it but you can hear it 
as well.  Now, I'm not sure what the target demographic is for this ... 
it could be for users who are driving, or perhaps for those that can't 
read. (?!) Anyway, the phone is only availabile now in Korea, but a deal
 with Verizon may be in the works, so something like this may be in the 
USA before too long.  So I guess that is something else we have to look 
forward to hearing while sitting in a movie theater, or the concert hall
 or church or wherever.

 of traffic. Of course, the downside is that you have to put up with

One of my last tasks in preparing for the recent release of <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4">Sphinx-4</a>
was to improve the performance of the <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/javadoc/edu/cmu/sphinx/linguist/dflat/DynamicFlatLinguist.html">DynamicFlatLinguist</a>
.  The DynamicFlatLinguist is used to generate the search graph used by
the decoder during speech recognition. The DynamicFlatLinguist
generates the search on-the-fly as the recognizer search algorithm
explores the graph. This allows very large and perplex grammars to be
used without incurring long grammar compile times or enormous memory
footprints. Although the DynamicFlatLinguist worked well in terms of
reducing startup time and overall memory footprint, it resulted in
recognition speeds of about 3X slower than that of the non-dynamic flat
linguist.  So my final task in preparing for the release was to reduce
the speed penalty of the DynamicFlatLinguist.
</p><p>
I had some idea where the bottlenecks in the linguist might be, but I
wasn't exactly sure and often times my intuition on such things is
just plain wrong, so I fired up <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/dashboard.php?id=90">JFluid</a> to profile
Sphinx-4 while using the DynamicFlatLinguist. One really powerful
aspect of JFluid is that it can profile a small subset of the code,
and this subset can easily be changed on the fly. So with JFluid, I
could get an overall profile to see where the recognizer was spending
its time, and then focus in directly on the hotspots related to the
DynamicFlatLinguist. JFluid showed me that my intuition was partially
correct about where the bottlenecks were, but it also showed a few
problem areas that I hadn't anticipated.  Based upon the JFluid
results, I was able to focus my optimization efforts on the proper
methods.  A cache here, a code hoist there and soon the
DynamicFlatLinguist was running 3 times faster.
</p><p>
JFluid continues to be one my favorite tools, but soon JFluid will be
no more. Not because it is going away, but because it is now being
incorporated into <a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>. As of
NetBeans 3.6 an <a href="http://profiler.netbeans.org/index.html">early access version of JFluid technology</a> can be incorporated directly into the IDE. 
JFluid will become the <b>NetBeans Profiler</b>.

What is over 50 feet tall, weighs about 20 tons and can throw a 50 lb 
pumpkin 1000 feet?  It's a trebuchet of course. This trebuchet was built
 by a <a href="http://www.yankeesiege.com/">Yankee Farmer</a> as a 
hobby.  During the fall (when there is a ready supply of ammunition), he
 fires off two shots an hour at the castle up on the hill.  Oh, did I 
mention he has a castle? What else would you aim a trebuchet at!  The 
shot is quite amazing, the pumpkin is in the air for eight seconds. At 
its peak of over 500 feet you can barely see the pumpkin.   
</p><p>
There's no charge to watch the shot, and last Saturday when I arrived 
with the kids there were probably 25 spectators hanging out. Of course 
the half-hour between shots gives you plenty of time to check out the 
farm stand and purchase some pumpkins or apples.    
</p><p>
Here's a picture of the trebuchet as it is being loaded

 and build his own trebuchet. Just on a smaller scale.  This instrument 
of warfare works just as well as its big brother.  It can throw the

				<p>
Willie, our fearless leader, just gave us the final <b>go!</b>, so <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4">Sphinx-4 1.0 beta</a>
 is officially released.  We've made quite a number of improvements over
 the last few months based upon user feedback. We are all quite proud of
 the work we've done on this system, building a world-class, 
state-of-the-art speech recognition system on the Java platform.
</p><p>
Here's the official announcement:
</p><p>
</p><pre>It is with great pleasure that we announce the 1.0 beta release of
Sphinx-4:

    http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4

In this release, we have provided the following new features and 
improvements over the 0.1 alpha release:

    - Confidence scoring
    - Dynamic grammar support
    - JSGF limitations removed
    - Improved performance for large, perplex JSGF grammars
    - Filler support for JSGF Grammars
    - Out-of-grammar utterance rejection
    - Narrow bandwidth acoustic model
    - WSJ5K Language model
    - More demonstration programs
    - Better control over microphone selection
    - Lots of bug fixes

Sphinx-4 is a state-of-the-art, speaker-independent, continuous speech
recognition system written entirely in the Java programming language.
It was created via a joint collaboration between the Sphinx group at
Carnegie Mellon University, Sun Microsystems Laboratories, Mitsubishi
Electric Research Labs (MERL), and Hewlett Packard (HP), with
contributions from the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC)
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

The design of Sphinx-4 is based on patterns that have emerged from the
design of past systems as well as new requirements based on areas that
researchers currently want to explore.  To exercise this framework,
and to provide researchers with a "research-ready" system, Sphinx-4
also includes several implementations of both simple and
state-of-the-art techniques.  The framework and the implementations
are all freely available via open source under a very generous
BSD-style license.

With the 1.0 beta release, you get the complete Sphinx-4 source tree
along with several acoustic and language models capable of handling a
variety of tasks ranging from simple digit recognition to large
vocabulary n-Gram recognition.

Because it is written entirely in the Java programming language,
Sphinx-4 can run on a variety of platforms without requiring any
special compilation or changes.  We've tested Sphinx-4 on the
following platforms with success: the Solaris 9 Operating System
on the SPARC platform, Mac OS X 10.3.5, RedHat 9.0, Fedora Core 1, 
Microsoft Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000. 

Please give Sphinx-4 1.0 beta a try and post your questions,
comments, and feedback to one of the CMU Sphinx Forums:

    https://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=1904

We are gearing up for the <b>1.0 Beta release </b> of <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4"> Sphinx-4</a> a speech recognizer written entirely in the Java programming language. One component of this release is this new paper called <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/doc/Sphinx4Whitepaper.pdf">Sphinx-4: A Flexible Open Source Framework for Speech Recognition</a>.
 This paper provides a good overview of the architecture of Sphinx-4, as
 well as a discussion of the accuracy and speed of the system.  The 
paper makes good reading if you are interested in how a speech 
recognizer works, or if you are interested in seeing how the Java 
platform performs for a domain such a speech recognition that requires a
 large amount of computing power.

Code reviews are good. Reviewers find bugs in your code, point out
inconsistencies, areas where you are misusing the Java language,
deviations from good style, and so forth.  The problem with code
reviewers is they usually get tired after a half an hour or so of
reviewing code, and the quality of the review drops off.
<p>
The program <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">FindBugs</a> is
a <i> bug pattern detector for java</i>. FindBugs is just like a code 
reviewer 
that never
gets tired. It scours through your code
and looks for potential bugs and problems and gives you a report. Unlike
 a human code reviewer, FindBugs doesn't give you that self-satisfied 
smirk when it finds a bug like the human reviewer does.
 
</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

In preparation for a major release of <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4">Sphinx-4</a>, I ran
FindBugs against our code base (about a 100K commented lines of code).
I'd rather not say exactly how many bugs FindBugs reported. Suffice it
to say that it was more than I expected.  Constants that were not
final, unused fields, inconsistent synchronization, all the types of
flaws that a good, tireless code reviewer would find.
<p>
I was surprised and impressed by the types of bugs FindBugs can find. It
 has proven to be extremely useful in improving my code quality.
I've added <b>FindBugs</b> to my set of must-use Java tools, next to <b>ant</b> and <b>jfluid</b>.

My 14 year old daughter is diagramming sentences in her English class.
She asked me to give her a few sentences to diagram so she could
prepare for tomorrow's quiz.  So I gave her the sentence:

</p><blockquote>
The old man the boat.
</blockquote>

Well, of course, she argued with me about how that was not a proper
sentence, that I was doing it wrong, and really I wasn't that good of
a father after all. After about 10 minutes of my insisting that it was
indeed a proper sentence and she just had to look a bit harder, I saw
the light dawn on her face.  "Oh, I see, 'man' can be a verb."
<p>
If she asks me for another sentence (which I rather doubt), I'll give
her this one:

</p><blockquote>
 The horse raced past the barn fell.
</blockquote>

<p>
<font size="-2">
<i>Update: Chris argues that 'raced past' is better than 'ran past', I agree.</i>

I enjoy programming puzzles, and as such I really like <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/mary/20040917">MaryMary's weekly Java puzzler</a>.  This weekend, while sorting out an   attic bookcase I came across my old copy of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201604612/qid=1095690011/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/002-0217159-0393627?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846"> The C Puzzle Book </a>
 by Alan Feuer.  I got this book way back in the early eighties when I 
was first learning C.  This book contains the memorable puzzle called <b>Pointer Stew</b>.  If you could work out what Pointer Stew output, you really knew your pointers, arrays and operator precedence.

</p><pre>char *c[]={
	"ENTER",
	"NEW",
	"POINT",
	"FIRST"
};
char **cp[]={c+3,c+2,c+1,c};
char ***cpp=cp;
main()
{
	printf("%s",**++cpp);
	printf("%s ",*--*++cpp+3);
	printf("%s",*cpp[-2]+3);
	printf("%s\n",cpp[-1][-1]+1);
}
</pre>

You just couldn't come up with such a complicated puzzle in Java (and that's a good thing).

NASA has been working on a system to recognize <a href="http://www.findbiometrics.com/viewnews.php?id=925"> sub-vocal speech</a>.
  With this system, a person need only mouth the words without actually 
uttering anything.  For very small vocabulary tasks, they were able to 
achieve 92% accuracy.  Someday, all of our cellphones will have this as a
 builtin, allowing you to converse while in the movie theater without 
bothering anyone around you (except maybe your date). In the mean time, 
its probably just best if you turn the phone off.
