A little while back, Nicholas Carr wrote a piece called "<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2005/09/headphaking.php" target="_self">Head Phakes</a>"
 that is all about how unknown artists are adopting a new strategy of 
covering songs by well known artists.&nbsp; When someone goes to iTunes 
and searchs for a song, not only does U2 or the Beatles come up, but the
 covering band does as well.&nbsp; I'm sure some of the new artists get 
sales just from confused or clueless consumers who can't tell the 
difference between the estabilished artist and the Newbie, but sometimes
 the covers are really interesting and unique interpretations that take 
the music into new directions. Those are the kinds of covers I like ... 
such as Johnny Cash's cover of <a target="_self" href="http://www.losthighwayrecords.com/e/cash11403.html">Hurt</a> by the nine inch nails.&nbsp; <br><br>There are a few sites out there devoted to help people find covers.&nbsp; My favorite is the <a href="http://www.coversproject.com/" target="_self">Cover Project</a>.<br><br>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<br>Probably the worst way to browse through a music collection is 
by having to read through long lists of words.&nbsp; The web is rife 
with them, <a target="_self" href="http://tobyinkster.co.uk/music-collection">like this</a>.&nbsp;
 Part of the joy of collecting music has always been&nbsp; to be able to
 interact with it physically, to hold an album in your hand, to read the
 liner notes, to arrange it, to show it off.&nbsp; In the digital world,
 all you really can do is to show people your iPod, it is not the 
same.&nbsp; I think that we'll start seeing some attempts at bringing 
back some of the pleasure that comes with interacting with your music 
collection.&nbsp; One attempt is <a target="_self" href="http://www.steelskies.com/coverflow/">CoverFlow</a>
 Coverflow allows you to browse through your album collection and 
interact with it, just like you use to be able to do.&nbsp; It is quite 
slick (although it is still in beta, requires a Mac and crashes a 
lot).&nbsp; It does remind me a bit of the <a target="_self" href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/projectlookingglass/ss12.jpg">looking glass CD app</a>
 that was demonstrated a few years back.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a picture of
 coverflow - click to see a video of CoverFlow in actions:<br><br>

				<br>Music charts have traditionally been a good way for people to 
find new music.&nbsp; Every week there's a new set of top ten (or top 
40, or top 200) songs to browse and listen to, and perhaps one is a 
keeper.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><img alt="" src="support_files/hdr_logo.html"><br><br>Nowadays there are a number of online music charts to explore ... There's trusty old <a target="_self" href="https://billboard.com/bbcom/charts.jsp">Billboard,</a> with its traditional charts organized by genre.&nbsp; Yahoo is now offering a Konfabulator widget that shows <a target="_self" href="https://www.yahoo.com/?widget=38264">the charts from Yahoo! Music Unlimited</a>.<br><br>My favorite set of online charts are from <a target="_self" href="https://www.last.fm/charts/">last.fm</a>.
 What's unique about the last.fm charts compared to the traditional 
Billboard charts is that Last.fm is tracking song plays, not song 
purchases.&nbsp; The more a song is played, the higher it goes in the 
charts while a song that is purchased but is never played goes 
nowhere.&nbsp; I've probably purchased 20 CDs this year, most of them 
based on the last.fm charts, and I've happily discovered bands that I 
didn't know before from <a target="_self" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Ferdinand_%28band%29">Franz Ferdinand</a>, to <a target="_self" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Cab_For_Cutie">Death Cab for Cutie</a>.&nbsp; The chart topper at last.fm this week is 'Such Great Heights' by the<a target="_self" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Postal_Service">Postal Service</a>, and it's next on my "to buy" list.<br><br><br>

			<h3><a href="a_new_way_of_selling.html" title="permalink">A new way of selling music for independent artists ..</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<a target="_self" href="http://www.tunecore.com/">TuneCore</a> is a 
music delivery and distribution service that lets you put your music up 
for sale on iTunes and Rhapsody.&nbsp; For less than $10.00 you can get 
an album put on sale at iTunes for a year. You keep all of the rights 
and all of the profits from sale.&nbsp; Getting music in the stores has 
always been one of the biggest barriers for independents, but now with 
TuneCore, independents have a low cost way of getting their music in one
 of the <a target="_self" href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/1db3e1ee-7706-11da-a7d1-0000779e2340.html">largest music stores</a>
 in the world.&nbsp; Of course, distribution and sale is only one aspect
 of selling music. Independents still have to find a way to promote 
their music, to get it heard by people so new listeners will&nbsp; want 
to buy it.&nbsp; That's still something that they'll have to do on their
 own.<br><br>For iTunes and Rhapsody, being the main distribution point 
for independent music will be a key distinguishing feature over the 
every shrinking music department in the local WalMart.&nbsp; Offering 
10,000,000 or 100,000,000 different songs, including songs by the band 
that plays in the local eatery every friday night will drive new 
customers to the online store.&nbsp; The key problem, however,&nbsp; for
 the iTune and Rhapsody is to figure out how to&nbsp; drive people into <a target="_self" href="https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html">the long tail</a>, to find new music that they'll like.&nbsp; <br><br>Already,
 there has been quite a bit of effort made around social recommendation 
and collaborative filtering to help people find new music. <a href="https://last.fm/" target="_self">Last.fm</a>
 is one of the most successful examples of this.&nbsp; However, social 
recommendation suffers from a 'popularity bias'. Social systems tend to 
favor what is popular, so what is popular gets recommended more and 
becomes even more popular.&nbsp; It is hard for an unknown independent 
artist to make headway with this type of recommendation.&nbsp; That's 
where content-based recommendation can be helpful.&nbsp; Content-based 
systems recommend music based on 'what it sounds like',&nbsp; instead of
 'who is listening to it'. With a content-based recommender I can say 
'find me music that sounds like the song "Take five"' and I should get a
 list of recommendations or songs that sound similar.&nbsp; <br><br>Currently there are very few content-based recommendation engines.&nbsp; There's <a href="http://www.predixis.com/" target="_self">Predixis</a>, that uses automated, computer analysis to determine similarity and <a href="https://www.pandora.com/" target="_self">Pandora</a>
 that uses musicians to characterize music conent.&nbsp; It's still 
early days for content-based recommenders,&nbsp; and there's plenty of 
room for improvement in the quality of recommendations.&nbsp; I suspect,
 though that soon these content-based recommenders will be key to 
driving listeners into the long tail, to help people find that 
independent artist.<br><br>20 years ago a new artist needed a record 
company to be successful for three reasons: the recording studio, the 
record promotion and the distribution channel.&nbsp; Today, a recording 
studio is cheap and distribution is easy.&nbsp; The last piece of the 
puzzle is helping listeners find the new artist's music.<br><br>

network neighbor, and then making slight modifications to that information, which 
includes pitches, timbres, and text messages, which are then all sent on to 
another network neighbor, eventually feeding back through the tree.  Ripples of 
data are sent through the network by the conductor, who defines the basic 
structure of the texture, but only has marginal control, given the subversive 
nature of most plorkers.<br><br></font></div><br>

				<br>Anyone who shops at Amazon is familiar with the "People who 
bought XXX also bought YYY"" recommendations that dominate the front 
page.   These recommendations must work because Amazon and other online 
stores rely on them heavily.  However, there are problems with these 
automated recommenders such as unfortunate pairings <a target="_self" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10736265/">made recently by Walmart.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 For one thing, Amazon doesn't seem to notice that kids grow up. Five 
years ago, for example, I bought some books in a series for my 9 
year-old daughter. Now five years later, I still get recommendations for
 books in the same series even though my daughter is 14 years old and 
wouldn't be caught dead reading a book from that series (at least she 
wouldn't be caught dead <span style="font-weight: bold;">being seen</span> reading one).&nbsp; <br><br><a target="_self" href="https://rfiebrink.blogspot.com/">Rebecca </a>points me to an article in yesterday's New York Times called "<a target="_self" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/23/technology/23recommend.html?emc=eta1">Like This? You'll hate that. (Not all web recommendations are welcome)</a>" that describes&nbsp; some of the problems with today's recommenders.&nbsp; An interesting read.<br><br><br>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<br>In his <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/" target="_self">Ongoing</a> blog Tim Bray mentions that he'll be giving a talk at this year's JavaOne called:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/20/Java-One" target="_self">Sigrid: The simplest possible grid computing platform</a><span class="ofp"><cite>.&nbsp;</cite>
 If I make it to JavaOne this year, I'll put this talk at the top of my 
list.&nbsp; There's a big gap right now in Grid Computing.&nbsp; There 
are Grid Computing APIs, but these seem to be designed for the 
traditional big iron apps like those used by chemical companies and Wall
 Street.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is hard to write grid apps with these 
APIs.&nbsp; In order to get more programmers and companies to think 
about moving their apps to the grid, it has to be easier to write grid 
apps.&nbsp; In particular this means:<br></span>
<ul>
<li>Use a friendly programming language like Java</li>
<li>Be able to develop and test on a desktop system</li>
<li>Have a minimal API</li></ul>&nbsp; As part of the Search Inside the 
Music project we often have to distribute large compute jobs over a 
network of computers.&nbsp; To help do this we've written a system 
called SPAWN (Spawn Processes and Wait Not) based upon JavaSpaces.&nbsp;
 We have a single method API:<br>


<pre>public &lt;T&gt; List&lt;Future&lt;T&gt;&gt; invokeAll(Collection&lt;Callable&lt;T&gt;&gt; tasks, long timeout);
</pre>

<p>With this method (based on the invokeAll method from the 
java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService), a programmer can build a list of 
tasks to be executed on the grid. The method will return a list of 
futures that are then used to determine when the tasks have completed 
(or failed).&nbsp; The SPAWN framework will put the callable tasks into a
 JavaSpace. Waiting on this space are SPAWN process servers that will 
pull the tasks out of the space, execute the code and put the answers 
back into the space where they are reaped by the client.&nbsp; The 
leases and transactions supported by JavaSpaces make this system very 
reliable. If any of the systems processing one of the tasks goes down 
its lease on the task will expire and the task will be given to another 
system to process.&nbsp; <br></p>
<p>I'll very interested in seeing what Tim's 'simplest possible grid 
computing platform' is like. I'm especially curious to see if it will be
 simpler than SPAWN.<br><br></p>
