 in Bilbao Spain last week, I had the opportunity to demonstrate the

system that helps people find new music by finding music that 'sounds 
similar' to music that they already like.&nbsp; I received quite a bit 
of positive feedback from people at the conference.&nbsp; Many folks 
wanted to learn more about how the system works.&nbsp; I have a 
two-pager that gives a general overview of how the system works.&nbsp;

<br><br>Social recommender systems are currently the best way to get<br>recommendations.&nbsp; They give pretty good recommendations, and are<br>pretty easy to implement.&nbsp; However, they are not perfect.&nbsp; They can<br>be susceptible to popularity bias, shilling, strange feedback loops and<br>all sorts of issues that can affect the quality of the<br>recommendations.<br><br>One such issue is known as the Donaldson-Bidet Effect.&nbsp; The DBE is<br>often seen when a new recommender system is brought online.&nbsp; It is a<br>feedback loop that results in an item that is no better than any other<br>item&nbsp; becoming heavily favored.<br><br>Here's what happens:&nbsp; The recommender has a number of new items in the<br>inventory. Since the items are new they are of equal popularity. When<br>the system presents the items in order of their popularity, no one<br>item is consistently on the top (since they all have the same<br>priority).<br><br>Now, if one of the items happens to appeal to some of the first users of<br>the system, that item will become slightly more popular than the other<br>items (since all the items are new, it only takes a few users showing<br>interest in an item to make it become the most popular).&nbsp; This slightly<br>more interesting item now starts to appear at the top of the 'Most<br>Popular Items' list.&nbsp; New visitors that come to the recommender will<br>now consistently see the slightly-favored item at the top of the list.<br>It is natural for users to show interest (i.e. click) on the most popular<br>item. This preference for the most popular item becomes the feedback loop.<br>Users will click on the the most popular item, increasing its popularity,<br>until it is entrenched at the top spot.<br><br>With the Donaldson-Bidet effect, what we see is that the early<br>visitors to a recommender have a strong influence over what becomes<br>popular.&nbsp; This is evident in some of the current music recommenders.<br>Sites like Last.FM have a strong bias towards artists like 'The Postal<br>Service', reflecting their nerd/geek origins, whereas sites like<br>Rhapsody revolve around Jack Johnson, while MyStrands recommenders<br>tend to favor Coldplay and Green Day.&nbsp; These preferences are<br>continually reinforced by users of these recommenders.<br><br><br>So how did the Donaldson-Bidet effect get its name? Well, it all<br>started at Recommenders06, the Recommendation Summer School held in<br>Bilbao Spain during September of 2006.&nbsp; A number of attendees planned<br>on taking photos of the conference and posting them on Flickr. One<br>of the first to post images was a PhD student named Justin Donaldson.<br>Among the pictures that Justin posted was this picture:<br><br><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/scwn/238280798/"><img src="support_files/238280798_4c6b04f517.jpg"></a><br><br>along the caption '<span style="font-style: italic;">Exciting new latrines in my hotel ... I'm kind of</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">frightened'</span>.&nbsp; This photo caught the eye of other Recommender06<br>attendees since it was slightly unusual, and clicked on it to see why<br>Justin was posting photos of his toilet and bidet.&nbsp; Very quickly, this<br>photo rose to the top of the Flickr "Most Interesting" list for<br>Recommender06 photos.&nbsp; Anyone visiting Flickr would find this photo as<br>one of the most interesting photos from Bilbao Spain.&nbsp; Thus the<br>Donaldson-Bidet effect was born.<br><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Update: To see the Donaldson-Bidet effect in action view the </span><a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=recommenders06&amp;s=int" target="_self">recommenders06 images sorted by 'interestingness'</a><br><br>

<br>&nbsp;A very strange thing happened today.&nbsp; I was at the local 
library with the kids, when I noticed a couple of guys wearing yellow 
shirts blowing up balloons.&nbsp; One fellow looked like a grad student,
 the other - a bit like Santa Claus. Santa looked a bit familiar.&nbsp; 
Looking a little closer I realized this guy blowing up balloons was none
 other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddog" target="_self">Jon "maddog" Hall</a>, executive director of Linux International and uber-linux-programmer.&nbsp; The other guy was <a href="http://majen.net/" target="_self">Matt Oquist</a>, one of the founders of 'Software Freedom Day'.&nbsp; <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/" target="_self">Software Freedom Day</a>
 is an effort to encourage the use of free and open source 
software.&nbsp; Jon and Matt were getting ready to pass out Ubuntu disks
 to any one who came by.&nbsp;&nbsp; I chatted with them for a 
bit.&nbsp; I was especially interested in hearing what Matt had to say 
about the use of open source in public schools. That's how he got 
started in the first place, trying to advocate for the use of free 
software in education.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I told them I worked for Sun, 
Maddog and Matt both wanted to know why Sun doesn't work harder at 
promoting Star Office / Open Office.&nbsp; I had no answer for 
them.&nbsp; Hey, I'm just a tech guy. But it did make me wonder why Sun 
is not working harder to get Open Office into schools. I cringe 
everytime I hear my kids talk about working on powerpoint presentations 
for homework.<br><br>I was really pleased to see what these guys were 
doing (and I was pleased that&nbsp; they gave me the latest Ubuntu CD as
 I need to upgrade my laptop).&nbsp; <br>

I've been travelling all week so I haven't had a chance to look at the
new iTunes 7.0 until just now.&nbsp; I've just installed it and now
itunes 7.0 is happily going through my collection to 'determine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gapless_playback" target="_self">gapless playback</a>
information'.&nbsp; I'm really excited about this. Until now, you would
always hear 1 second or so gaps of silence between songs.&nbsp; This
was fine for normal albums but if you listened to a concept album like
Tommy, or Sgt. Pepper's or Dark Side of the Moon,&nbsp; the gap would
just destroy the seemless transitions between songs.&nbsp; It looks
like iTunes 7.0 will build a database of song transition timings so
iTunes can put the proper amount of silence between songs.&nbsp; It
looks like its going to take an hour or so to figure out the gaps for
my 6,500 songs ... so I'll try it out soon.&nbsp; Can't wait!&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Update:&nbsp; Well, it looks like the gapless playback only works with the new 5th generation iPods ... bummer.</span><br>

				<br>One of the challenges of trying to build a music similarity 
model is figuring out how to evaluate the model.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no 
absolute ground truth that you can rely on (something that you can do 
with other tasks such as artist identification).&nbsp; Some researchers 
have proposed some good ways of estimating similarity performance but 
when it gets right down to it&nbsp; there's no real substitute for human
 judgement - having people listen to two songs and decide whether or not
 they are similar.<br><br><br>This year as part of <a href="http://ismir2006.ismir.net/" target="_self">ISMIR 2006</a>, <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/mirex2006/index.php/Main_Page" target="_self">MIREX</a>
 (the Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange) is organizing the
 first music similarity evaluation. The centerpiece of the evaluation is
 a human evaluation. Human judges listening to music to decide how 
similar songs are to a seed song.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br><a href="http://support_files/eval.gif" target="_self"><img src="support_files/eval.gif"></a><br><br>The evaluation is coordinated by the Evalutron 6000 that is being created by Dr Stephen Downie and his <a href="http://www.music-ir.org/evaluation/" target="_self">IMIRSEL</a>
 team.&nbsp; Stephen and his ace crew have done a great job figuring out
 how to put together a system to make the evaluations 
possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably the hardest thing to do is to figure out 
how to setup an evaluation that will satisfy all of the 
researchers.&nbsp; Everyone has an opinion about how such an evaluation 
should be done and it is harder than herding cats getting everyone to 
agree.<br><br>There's a<a href="http://www.music-ir.org/evaluation/eval6000/" target="_self"> sandbox version of the Evalutron 6000 </a> that you can try if you are curious to see how the evaluation works.<br><br>I<br>

				The <a href="https://images.google.com/imagelabeler/" target="_self">Google Image Labeler</a>
 is a game where you and a web partner try to agree on a label on an 
image.&nbsp; The more images you and your partner identicaly label the 
more points you get. &nbsp; Of course, at the same time, google is 
collecting all sorts of human-applied labels that it can then use to 
improve its image search function.&nbsp; It's a great way to get humans 
to help classify images without having to pay them<br><br>It seems that a
 similar technique could be used to help apply labels to music.&nbsp; 
The labels could then be used to help cross the semantic gap, and allow 
people to search for music based upon content-based keywords.&nbsp; 
Teaching computers how to extract meaningful acoustic labels from audio 
is a hard job.&nbsp; Getting humans to provide the labels by getting 
them involved in an engaging game, where the labels are generated as a 
sideproduct would be a great way to collect this data.&nbsp; The 
resulting labels would be extremely useful for researchers and music 
search engine creators.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, audio and images are very
 different media.&nbsp; A game that works well with images won't work 
well with audio. So the trick is to figure out how capture&nbsp; the 
labelling process in an engaging activity.&nbsp; Sounds like a good 
masters thesis for some music technologist.<br>

				NPR says that they will be creating a 'major digital music service' 
with a scheduled roll out early next year.&nbsp; According to their 
press release:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The centerpiece of the digital music service will be a supersite
pooling the public radio system’s collective resources, enabling users
to learn and explore, creating communities and offering exposure for
emerging and non-mainstream artists. It will encompass all music forms
- including classical, jazz, folk, opera, AAA, electronica and
alternative - reflecting the breadth of genres and tastes already
offered to users of the 815 public radio stations around the country
and their partner websites.<br><br></div>It is unclear whether this will be free content, paid content or a mixture&nbsp; of both. <br>

				<br>I was using a web service provided by one of the web 2.0 music<br>discovery companies.&nbsp; I was&nbsp; having a bit of trouble ... the API just<br>didn't let me do what I wanted to do.&nbsp; I explained my difficulty to one<br>of the startup developers. Five minutes later I got an email describing<br>a modified API that now did what I needed it to do ... and the change<br>was not only described, it had been implemented and deployed!<br><br>This kind of nimbleness is a hallmark of web 2.0. Development is<br>lightweight, changes are easy to make and deploy.&nbsp; It doesn't hurt when<br>the main developer pushing out a change is also one of the founders of<br>the company. When the developer is in charge, things can happen fast.<br><br>In larger companies though, like Sun, it is hard to be nimble.&nbsp; We have<br>lawyers, we have branding, we have trademark police.&nbsp; We have security<br>reviews, firewalls and proxies.&nbsp; We have lots of processes in<br>place to protect the interests of Sun.&nbsp; All of these processes take<br>the all the nimbleness (and the fun) out of the development process.<br><br>A month or so ago I decided to take a deep dive into web 2.0.&nbsp; I figured<br>the best way to learn this stuff was to actually do it.&nbsp; So I wrote a<br>web2.0 mashup. I think it is pretty cool and&nbsp; I think others will think<br>so too.&nbsp; Now, if I was working for myself, I'd just toss the app up on<br>one of those commercial web hosting services and I'd be done. My app<br>would be deployed, people would be using it, I'd be happy. However,<br>I'm working for Sun, so instead of deploying the app, I am trying to<br>figure out how to navigate through all of the proper procedures to get<br>it deployed. I suspect that by the time I get this mashup out there, I'll<br>have spent more time wending through the processes than I did actually<br>writing the software.<br><br>I know Sun can be nimble and flexible. The fact that I can write this<br>in my Sun blog is a testament to that fact.&nbsp; But if we are going to do<br>the web 2.0 thing, we have to be able to act more like a web 2.0 company.<br>Perhaps it is time for us to form the 'Nimbleness 2.0 exploratory<br>committee' that can (after a few months) make some recommendations<br>about how we can be more nimble.<br><br>

There's a nice teaser at <a href="http://www.partystrands.com/" target="_self">partystrands.com</a>-
 where we learn that partyStrands is the "future of interactive music 
and community".&nbsp; PartyStrands is part of the MyStrands music 
recommendation empire.&nbsp; The PartyStrands site doesn't go 'live' 
until September 14th, so we won't know for sure until then what 
partyStrands is but let me take a guess anyway.<br><br>I'm guessing that
 if you go to a PartyStrands-enabled club or party you'll be able to add
 songs to the party playlist via a kiosk computer or even your mobile 
phone and PartyStrands will work out the playlist for the party based 
upon what people are requesting.&nbsp; PartyStrands will have to deal 
with intelligent song ordering, and of course playlist vandalism 
(there's always that guy who tries to add death metal to the Barry 
Manilow set).&nbsp; The MyStrands folk already know a whole bunch about 
playlists and social music, so I'm guessing they'll be able to do a 
pretty good job. &nbsp; <br><br>Now this is all just my 
speculation&nbsp; PartyStrands could be something completely different 
... we'll just have to wait a couple of weeks ...<br><br><br>

				I was saddend to hear that big band jazz great <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynard_ferguson" target="_self">Maynard Ferguson</a>
has passed away.&nbsp; Maynard's "Live at Jimmy's" was a staple of my
formative highschool listening&nbsp; years.&nbsp; Maynard defined the
'trumpet-hero' genre with his incredible power and range.&nbsp;
Maynard's jazz/rock fusion style opened the door to jazz for many like
myself who grew up listening to rock.&nbsp; He will be missed.
