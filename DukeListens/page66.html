				<p>
The key to sounding like an american when speaking English is not how 
well you pronounce the words, but, instead how well you mis-pronounce 
the words.  Intead of saying <i>better</i> say <i>bedder</i>, instead of <i>talking</i> say <i>talkin'</i>,  instead of saying <i>got you</i> say <i>gotchew</i>.  The site <a href="http://www.spokenamericanenglish.com/">SpokenAmericanEnglish.com</a>
 has a number of cases and examples of how best to mispronounce our fair
 language. So today, when it is time for lunch you can say to your 
office mate: <a href="http://home.bluemarble.net/%7Elangmin/miniatures/colloq.htm">"Jeet Jet?"</a>.

The folks in the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/cogmac/projects.html">Cognitive Machines Group</a> at <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">The MIT Media Lab </a> have built a robot that allows them to
"investigate connections between natural language semantics,
perception, and action".  The robot, called <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/cogmac/projects/ripley.html">Ripley</a>,
is a seven-degree-of-freedom robot with many sensors, including touch,
vision, gravity, position and sound.
 You can talk to Ripley about its world of
objects, and Ripley will understand you.  

There's an <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/cogmac/publications/bishop.pdf">interesting 
paper</a>
on how they use a visually grounded language model to allow
descriptions of scenes in a  natural way. Some sample phrases are:
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>

<font color="green">
<pre>the green one on the left that's hidden by a purple one

on the left the purple one that's all the way in the corner and it's separate

in the middle towards the right there's a line of purple ones and then
there's a kink in the line and the one that's right where the lines turns

the purple one all the way on the right in the front
</pre>
</font>
</p><p>
Using phrases such as this, a person can command Ripley to select
and manipulate a single object amongst a group of objects.  Ripley
can distinguish objects based on size, color, weight (it will weigh
objects if it needs to), position, and relation to other objects.
</p><p>
Ripley uses  <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/">Sphinx-4</a> for speech recognition.  The
folks in the Cognitive Machines Group have been great folks to work
with and have contributed many good features and enhancements to
Sphinx-4.

I see over at <a href="http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0408&amp;L=javasound-interest&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=1651">JavaSound Interest archive</a> that Florian Bomers (aka Mr. JavaSound) has left Sun. Florian says:

</p><blockquote>
Hi Javasounders!
<p>
I have left my position at Sun. I've had sufficient time (and I worked
until the last minute) to ensure that Java Sound in 1.5 is in good
shape, and that my successor will find enough and complete information
for a smooth start. I also offered Sun to assist where needed. I
wouldn't want Java Sound to receive less attention than before!
</p><p>
The decision to leave is part of my original plan to stay at Sun for the
duration of the development cycles of 1.4.1, 1.4.2 and 1.5.
</p><p>
Now I will take up my own business, in the field of music software (but
a specific plan is not yet set in stone). I will continue my engagement
with this mailing list, and I plan to increase my activity for the
tritonus and jsresources.org projects.
</p><p>
Therefore "goodbye" as official Sun representative, and "hello" from here!
</p><p>
Florian
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Florian was a great resource and worked very hard to make the JavaSound API work well. He will be greatly missed. 
</p><p>
Now, I wonder what is going to happen with JavaSound.  Recall <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/pub/wlg/154">Josh Simon's post</a>
 of last year calling for a major overhaul of JavaSound. Maybe now is 
the time to take a long hard look at JavaSound and see where it should 
go next. 
</p><p>
I'd like to see, at the very least, an effort to ensure equivalent 
behavior across all supported platforms.  Our speech engines make 
extensive use of JavaSound and the biggest issue we have in supporting 
Solaris, Linux, OS X and Win32 is differences in behavior of JavaSound 
across the different platforms.

<a href="http://www.gignews.com/">GigNews</a> as a good article called <a href="http://www.gignews.com/fdlspeech1.htm">Speech Interfaces for Games</a>,
 that gives a good basic overview of how speech recognition works and 
gives a hint about some of the difficulties in writing good speech apps.
  A good read. Here's a snippet:


</p><blockquote>
<b>Scenario #1</b>
<pre>Computer: "Captain, do you want to open hailing frequencies, 
open fire or activate the Jump Drive?"

User: "Fire all weapons on the nearest enemy frigate."

Computer: "Fire lasers, missiles or all weapons?"

User: "All weapons."

Computer: "Fire on a frigate, a battleship or a freighter?"

User: "I said the nearest enemy frigate!"

Computer: "There are three enemy frigates within range: the Saratoga, 
the Seville and the San Diego. Which one do you want to target?"

User: "The nearest, damn you!"

Computer: "I'm sorry, I did not understand. Please try again."

User: "Malefice! You foul silicon-based denizen of the tar
 pits of Hell! A plague on you and your unnatural family!"

<i>Ship is broad-sided by an enemy battle cruiser and destroyed.</i>
</pre>
<p>
Scenario #1 is an example of a fixed-initiative system, and a rather bad
 one. (Effective fixed-initiative systems are in common use in 411 
directory assistance; they are still somewhat brittle and work without 
human intervention in a mere fraction of calls, but the phone company 
still saves fortunes thanks to them.)
</p><p>
Scenario #1's computer asks all the questions, handles very specific 
answers, and doesn't even listen to anything else. If the user 
volunteers information to try to speed up the interaction, the computer 
will ignore it until the "proper" time for this bit of data is reached. 
Only in the simplest of cases (and with the most docile of users) will a
 fixed-initiative dialogue achieve good results quickly and naturally.

				<p>
Every morning I check the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=382337">Sphinx-4 support forums</a> for
questions that people have about using Sphinx-4. There are usually a
handful of questions that have magically surfaced overnight. I dutifully
spend anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour or more providing answers to
the questions posed by Sphinx-4 users.  Some of the questions are very
basic. Those are easy to answer, I just point them to the FAQ or some
other document on-line that provides the answers.  Sometimes, though,
the questions are more difficult.  These are questions that push the
envelope. These questions reveal:

</p><ul>
<li> Parts of Sphinx-4 with poor documentation
</li><li> Areas in Sphinx-4 with a cumbersome API
</li><li> Common use cases that are not easily implemented with the current API
</li><li> Poor error messages
</li></ul>
<p>

My daily dose of support gives me a strong hint about where we need to
improve Sphinx-4. This close interaction with users helps me understand how
people are using Sphinx-4, what areas are confusing, what features need to be
supported. I get a good idea how to make the system better.  I think this one
of the best attributes of the open source model. The tight feedback loop
between users and developers leads to a much better system.

Willie pointed out this interesting Newsday article <a href="https://www.newsday.com/business/local/newyork/ny-bzvoic033916206aug03,0,6068505.story?coll=ny-nybusiness-headlines">Spanish callers
get lost in translation</a> about the added difficulties in designing
an automated voice recognition system that is to be used by 
multi-lingual speakers. Here's a snippet:
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
 Part of the reason is that people don't always use pure Spanish,
 speech experts said, but a mix of Spanish and English. Some Hispanics
 might say, "uno dos tres Seventh Ave." Others might say, "one
 twenty-three Seventh Avenue." Still others might say "uno dos tres
 Septima Avenida," or "uno dos tres Avenida Siete," and other
 possibilities.
</blockquote>
<p>
Building a voice recognition  system that works well with native 
English speakers is challenging enough, but that is not going to 
good enough for a large (and growing) segment of the population.

I'm just back from a trip to the west coast.  Willie and I spent three
days in Mountain View giving demos of <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/">FreeTTS</a> and <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4">Sphinx-4</a> at 
the Sun Labs open house.  For a quick lunch
one day, we stopped into <a href="http://www.in-n-out.com/">In-N-Out
Burger</a>, a fast food burger joint.  They don't have these on the
east coast.  The In-N-Out menu is very simple, three kinds of
hamburgers, french fries, and drinks. That's it.
The place was clean, the burger was good, what more could you ask for.
<br>
<p>
This serves as a good model for API design, unlike McDs, In-N-Out has
tried to keep their interface (the menu) nice and simple. And since
their API is so simple (just burgers and fries, no fajitas, no apple
pies, no chicken, no fish, no salads), they can do a good job.  It's
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1555581234/qid=1091445287/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-2332674-7549718?v=glance&amp;s=books">The
Unix Philosophy</a> applied to hamburgers: <i>Make each program do one
thing well</i>. The advantages of a small menu are obvious. Shorter
lines since customers don't spend too much time deciding on what to
have, and better food (since they are just cooking burgers, they can make them to order).
</p></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

I have seen APIs that use the McDs approach ... give the customer all
the choices.  Look at the <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">log4j
API</a>. It is a logging and tracing package.  Now, in my mind,
logging packages should be pretty straight forward. They need to take
a message, classify it and send it somewhere to be output. Looking at
the <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/api/index.html">log4j
API</a> I see over <b> 120 classes</b> in the API. This API is so big there's
a whole <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/2970036908/qid=1091446564/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i2_xgl14/102-2332674-7549718?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">book</a> describing it. 
In my mind, that is way
too complicated, too many choices. All I really want to do is this:
<pre>    Logger.log(WARN, "Coffee is too hot");
</pre>
<p>
API designers need to walk the fine line between functionality and 
usability. Too much functionality can limit the appeal of an API. Just 
give me a burger with fries
please.

Tony Printezis, a researcher here at Sun Labs has developed a tool for visualizing the java heap. <a href="http://www.experimentalstuff.com/Technologies/GCspy/">GCSpy</a>
 is an adaptable heap visualization tool that lets you look at what is 
in your heap, how the different heap regions are being used, as well as 
size of the different heap regions overtime.  It is a good tool to help

A while back, Bryan <a href="http://www.scruffles.net/blog/archive/000011.html">posted a program </a> that renders a spoken version of the classic "99 bottles of beer on the wall" using <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/">FreeTTS 1.1</a>.
 Well, Bryan was using lower level (non-JSAPI) FreeTTS API and things 
have changed in this API a bit with the release of FreeTTS 1.2, so I 
thought I'd update the source so it will work with 1.2.  This little 
code snippet, when coupled with FreeTTS will indeed sing the whole song,
 without ever getting tired.

</p><pre>import com.sun.speech.freetts.Voice;
import com.sun.speech.freetts.VoiceManager;

public class BottlesOfBeer  {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        VoiceManager voiceManager = VoiceManager.getInstance();
        Voice voice = voiceManager.getVoice("kevin16");

        if (voice == null) {
            System.err.println( "Cannot find kevin16");
            System.exit(1);
        }

        voice.allocate();
        for (int i = 99; i &gt; 0; i--) {
            String verse = i + getBottle(i) + " of beer on the wall, " +
                    i + getBottle(i) + " of beer. " +
                    "Take one down,  Pass it around, " +
                    (i - 1) + getBottle(i - 1) + "of beer on the wall.";
            voice.speak(verse);
        }
        voice.speak("Thank you everyone.  You've been a great audience.  " +
                "I'll be here all week!");

        /* Clean up and leave.
         */
        voice.deallocate();
        System.exit(0);
    }

    public static String getBottle(int numberOfBottles) {
        return numberOfBottles != 1 ? " bottles" : " bottle";
    }
}

</pre>

I figured with all those kids heading out to camp this summer with their
 laptops, they can just fire this up on those bus rides instead of 
having to sing it themselves.

Oh, and be sure to check out <a href="http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/">www.99-bottles-of-beer.net</a> for 621 variations of this program in just about every programming language ever written. A most valuable resource.

Steve Pietrowicz just left a comment saying "nice demo" for ZipCity.  
Steve has to be the King of the Cool demos.  Check out this <a href="http://www.magiclamp.org/smart/">Smart Environments</a>
 project that he did at the National Center for Supercomputing 
Applications. Steve used Java and Jini to create an environment of 
hardware and software services that was able to interact with people in a
 variety of ways. This room included a video wall with a 8192x3840 
display.  Check out the picture. 
</p><p>
At JavaOne 2002 Steve won the <a href="http://servlet.java.sun.com/javaone/sf2002/info/features/helix.en.jsp">Helix software competition</a>
 with a program that used Java3D and FreeTTS to simulate a scanner to 
discover DNA sequence errors. The program shows the nucleotides being 
scanned, and FreeTTS announced when the program encounters errors.
</p><p>
So Steve, King of the Demos ... thanks for the kudos.
</p><p>

Willie has started a new forum on the <a href="http://freetts.sourceforge.net/docs/index.php">FreeTTS Website</a> at SourceForge  called <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=392174">FreeTTS Sightings</a>
 where people can post a description of their project or paper that uses
 FreeTTS.  There's already a dozen or so projects listed.
</p><p>
If you are a user of FreeTTS and want to share information about your project, please post it at the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=392174">FreeTTS Sightings Forum</a>
</p><p>
We'll be setting up a similar area for <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/">Sphinx-4</a> soon.

In preparation for next week's dog and pony show, I've revamped our ZipCity demo of <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4">Sphinx4</a>.
 Now when you speak a zip code, ZipCity will show the location of the 
city on the map of the continental USA.  Here's a screenshot:
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/zip2.jpg">
</p><p>
You can try it out here: <a href="http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/sphinx4/zipcity2/zipcity.jnlp"> ZipCity Version 2</a>. 
</p><p>
 This is still, as far as I know, the only downloaded app in the world that includes a speech recognizer.
</p><p>
The new look of ZipCity was heavily inspired by  Ben Fry's  <a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/zipdecode/">zipdecode</a>. Mr. Fry specializes in developing systems for visualizing large and changing sets of data.  His <a href="http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/">MIT website</a> has numerous novel examples. Well worth checking out.
