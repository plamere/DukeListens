time - at the Lamere household we spend a good deal of that time playing
 games - board games and card games - no electricity required.&nbsp; We 
have lots of favorites: Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan, Attack of the 
Killer Rabits,&nbsp; Citadels, Apples to Apples, Ticket to Ride, Elfin 
Land. <br><br>I'm starting to cast about for this year's holiday week 
game - it has to allow for 3 to 5 players - be suitable for ages 12 and 
up and fun - so I'm open to any suggestions.<br></p>

			<h3><a href="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/sleevenotez_-_the_%C3%BCbermashup.html" title="permalink">Sleevenotez - The ÃœberMashup</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>A few months ago, I had one of those 'oh crap!' moments - I was working on <a href="http://snappradio.com/">Snapp Radio</a>, my mashup of music and photos - when someone sent me an email with that contained just a URL: <a href="http://www.sleevenotez.com/">http://www.sleevenotez.com/.</a>&nbsp;
 I took&nbsp; a quick look at their site and saw to my increasing dread 
that they were making a mashup that seemed to be very similar to Snapp 
Radio - while you listen to music they would show related information 
about what you were listening to.&nbsp; Looking a little closer - I 
realized that what sleevenotez was doing is very different than Snapp 
Radio - Snapp Radio is a <i>lean-back</i> interface - it is meant to be 
something that you enjoy in the background - sort of a relaxing backdrop
 to your music - something you could use while you are <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/bond/entry/schnapps_radio_-_woah_i">taking a bath</a> whereas sleevenotez is a <i>lean-forward</i> type of interface - something you use when you want to be actively engaged with your music.<br></p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.sleevenotez.com/"><img src="support_files/sleeve.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Sleevenotez is a music companion website. Their byline is '<i>reatime info for your digital music'.</i>&nbsp;
 While you listen to music Sleevenotez will scurry off to various 
corners of the web to collect information about the artist and song you 
are listening too, and display it - providing a single page that gives 
you just about everything you'd want to know about an artist.&nbsp; 
Sleevenotez currently shows you:</p><ul><li><b>Artist biography </b>- from the wikipedia</li><li><b>Discography -&nbsp; </b>from MusicBrainz</li><li><b>CDs for Sale -&nbsp; </b>from Amazon</li><li><b>Photos of the artists - </b>from Flickr</li><li><b>Videos of the artists - </b>from YouTube</li><li><b>Lyrics for the song - </b>from Lyrc.com.ar</li></ul><p>Sleevenotez
 determines what your are currently listening to using the last.fm 
audioscrobbler 'now playing' feed.&nbsp; Thus there are a total 7 
services combined by sleevenotez to build the artist/song page.&nbsp; 
You can also use sleevenotez to quickly aggregate information about an 
artist even if you are not listening to a song - they have an easy to 
understand URL syntax - so its easy to just plug in a URL like<a href="http://www.sleevenotez.com/artist/weezer"> http://www.sleevenotez.com/artist/weezer</a> to bring up all of the information about Weezer.</p><p>The
 Sleevenotez team have an excellent design sense - they have all of the 
Web 2.0 design goodness - pleasing color selections, curved borders, 
killer logo,&nbsp; fading transitions - it is really quite a slick 
interface - very polished for an alpha release - a very pleasing 
experience all the way around. The information that they present is well
 organized,&nbsp; tt's&nbsp; not overdone, there's no ajax for ajax sake
 - the sleevenotez teams shows they have great design chops.<br></p><p> <img src="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/support_files/title_button.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br></p><p>Sleevenotez
 is an alpha and as such there are a few problems.&nbsp; The biggest 
problem right now is that the 'realtime info' is delayed by several 
minutes - if you are listening to a song, the info for the song doesn't 
appear until the song is nearly over.&nbsp; This is an unfortunate side 
effect of using the last.fm web audioscrobbler web service - tracks are 
only scrobbled by the scrobbler when they have played for at least a 
certain amount of time (usually at least 50%).&nbsp; The result is that 
sleevenotez is always behind by a couple of minutes.&nbsp; The 
sleevenotez team is well aware of this issue - and have a<a href="http://blog.sleevenotez.com/2006/10/forward_ever_backward_never.html"> plan to fix</a> this (but this relies on some changes in how last.fm does things) that may take a while before this gets sorted out.</p><p>&nbsp;Sleevenotez
 does on occasion have some trouble finding the right data - sometimes 
it will show wrong information in the bio section - data about the 
Buddist notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana">trancendental happiness </a>instead of a biography of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_%28band%29">Seattle rock band</a>, or punt on the lyrics, or show non-related photos - it is hard to get this right - try finding photos on <a href="https://flickr.com/search/?q=blur&amp;w=all">Flickr for the band 'blur'</a> - but since this is an alpha, we can cut sleevenotez some slack, I'm sure they'll improve this over time.<br></p><p>Ultimately
 sleevenotez may have a bigger problem with their business model - many 
of the webservices that they rely on - last.fm and flickr for instance -
 have <i>terms-of-service</i> that allow for non-commercial use of the 
services. Sooner or later sleevenotez may start making money with their 
site - via Amazon referrers or advertising (they may already be doing 
that now) - when that happens they'll have to make commercial 
arrangements with their data providers to avoid violating the 
terms-of-service - and that may be quite difficult.&nbsp; For now, most 
companies are content to look the other way and let people mashup their 
data - its all part of growing an ecosystem around one's data - it 
certainly can help companies like last.fm for instance if alternative 
interfaces spring up that ultimately drive people to use the last.fm 
plugin - but last.fm may also get a bit chuffed if a site like 
sleevenotez starts to siphon away Amazon referrers - it would only take a
 'cease-and-desist' letter from a last.fm lawyer (or do they call them 
solicitors over there?) to make the house of cards come tumbling 
down.&nbsp; </p><p>The sleevenotez team has been blogging about 
sleevenotez development - they are agile developers and have even gone 
so far as to put some of their agile process data in their blog - here's
 <a href="http://blog.sleevenotez.com/2006/08/iteration_1_is_over.html">iteration #1.</a> I&nbsp; like that open development model.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm
 really excited to see sleevenotez - it's a great mashup - and a very 
useful music companion.&nbsp; I'm guessing the sleevenotez team will 
continue to add more data to set of info shown for an artist and song - 
album reviews, related artists, social tags, playlists,&nbsp; upcoming 
concerts - anything you'd want to know about an artist.&nbsp; Once they 
get the alpha kinks out of the system - the scrobbler-delay - and the 
misguided data&nbsp; - sleevenotez will be one of the best ways to learn
 more about the artists that perform our favorite music.&nbsp; It will 
be interesting too, to see how they navigate through the uncharted legal
 territory of trying to build&nbsp; a business on top of mashup 
webservices. <br></p>

I just spent the better part of an afternoon debugging my Tivo - seems 
that it stopped talking to the Tivo cloud sometime last week and ran out
 of program info.  At first I though the USB to ethernet adapter had 
failed, then I thought that the long cable run was suspect, but it turns
 out that my Linksys router was in the process of dying - it was no 
longer holding a configuration - so a quick trip to staples for a new 
router and everything is back up and running - tomorrow I guess I'll 
return the extra usb-ethernet adapter.&nbsp; This is a hint of the 
future - instead of an afternoon in the garage fixing the car, its an 
afternnon in the livingroom debugging the TV. SIgh.

I've been using the <a href="http://findory.com/">Findory</a> lately as 
personal newspaper of sorts - the findory keeps track of which stories 
and blog posts I read and based upon these stories gives me new related 
content every time I visit.&nbsp; I don't have to explicitly rate 
stories, the Findory just figures things out based upon what I've 
read.&nbsp; One neat thing about the Findory is that next to most 
stories there's a little icon:&nbsp;<img src="support_files/personalized-icon.html" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0">
 that tells me that the story was selected just for me - if I click on 
the icon, the Findory will tell me why that story was selected.&nbsp; 
The Findory also mixes in other stories that are not recommended 
specifically for me, I assume because they are of general interest. <br><br>This
 week,&nbsp; there have been an overabundance of stories about Britney 
Spears and her lack of underwear on the Findory page.&nbsp; Looking at 
the Findory right now I see 8 non-personalized general interest stories -
 4 of them - are about Britney Spears' privates.&nbsp; Perhaps the 
Findory is just reflecting what is going on in the blogosphere at large -
 but I really wish there was a way I could tell the Findory that I am 
not now, nor will I ever be interested in this kind of celebrity 
news.&nbsp; Perhaps, the Findory will eventually figure out that I never
 click on these stories and will eliminate them, but I wish I could just
 make them go away now. So <a href="https://glinden.blogspot.com/">Greg,</a> what can I do?<br></p>

tempo and beat intensity and will write the BPM data to your iTunes

are 130 BPMs.&nbsp; Tangerine is still in beta - it has a few rough 
edges - and the BPM isn't always accurate - but hey! its a beta&nbsp; - 
the UI is quite polished and the analysis is fairly fast (3 seconds per 
song). &nbsp;&nbsp; One note - if you have a lot of purchased music, you
 are out of luck - Tangerine can't analyze music that is DRM protected.</p><p align="center"><a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/tangerine/"><img src="support_files/ss_main.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a>&nbsp;</p>

Last week, I gave a half-baked talk in the labs about<a href="http://snappradio.com/"> Snapp Radio</a>
 - explaining a bit about how Snapp Radio uses social tags from last.fm 
to select relevant photos from Flickr.  I used 'emo' as an example 
showing how songs labeled as 'emo' get associated with pictures labeled 
with 'emo' . One of the researchers asked 'What is Emo?' - so I gave a 
totally inadequate description of this musical genre.  Now, if you 
really want to know what Emo is - then check out the site <a href="http://www.fourfa.com/">What the heck *is* emo, anyway?</a> - it is a basic FAQ and primer on all things emo.&nbsp;
And there are lots of <a href="https://flickr.com/search/?s=int&amp;w=all&amp;q=emo&amp;m=tags">great emo photos on flickr</a>.<br clear="all">

 things are being reconfigured now - so if you are inside Sun and can't 
get to Snapp Radio, try again in a few hours.</p><p>Now we are watching 
the Snapp Radio server to see how well it stands up to the Big Mashup 
load - its an old server - but so far it seems to be managing the 
load.&nbsp; Since I'm not really a web app developer I'm interested in 
seeing how well (or not) this app scales to many users.&nbsp; <br></p><p><a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/features/thebigmashup.html"><img src="support_files/MashupBanner.html" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="90%"></a>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>This&nbsp; Wired article:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.wired.com/news/technology/internet/0,72182-0.html?tw=wn_technology_2">Fine Tune Your Music Discoveries&nbsp;</a>
 is a quick review of 4 popular music discovery sites: Pandora, Last.Fm.
 iLike and QLoud.&nbsp; The author gets it a bit wrong when he says that
 all of these sites use collaborative filtering to recommend music - 
Pandora relies on content-based matching of content, not collaborative 
filtering.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, the author liked the Pandora 
recommendations best. The author does point out the problem that 
collaborative systems have with popularity bias: <i>Oddly, I found the more mainstream an artist is, the less precise your
results are likely to be. The recommended artists similar to Neutral
Milk Hotel, which is arguably the most left-field pick of the three,
were almost universally more accurate across all four services.</i>&nbsp; I do agree with the article that the QLoud's Ajax-heavy site is a bit of a turn off.&nbsp;</p>

 find similar artists that happen to be in your collection and displays 
songs by those artists.&nbsp; The app is clean and simple to use - just

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/">RateYourMusic.com</a> is an 
online community of music fans that review and rate music.&nbsp; RYM has
 thousands of users with millions of ratings and reviews.&nbsp; It is 
rather amazing how much depth there is in the RYM review catalog.&nbsp; 
Abbey Road has been rated 3,680 times and has 433 reviews. The latest 
Pearl Jam album has 587 ratings and 69 written reviews.&nbsp; Naturally,
 some of the reviews are your typical one word fanboy reviews: 'awesome'
 - but many of the reviews are well written, detailed explorations of 
the album - such as these reviews for <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/neutral_milk_hotel/in_the_aeroplane_over_the_sea/">In the Aeroplay Over the Sea</a> by Neutral Milk Hotel.</p><p>With
 all of these reviews and ratings, RYM can give us all sorts of nifty 
charts - such as top albums (Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited is the 
alltime top album according to RYM). worst albums (William Hung is #2 on
 this list) and&nbsp; <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/stats/mostowned">Most owned albums</a>, <br></p><p>Once
 you've rated a number of albums, RYM will give you recommendations 
based upon those ratings, as well as connect you to other users who have
 similar musical tastes.</p><p>&nbsp;RYM is a super source of reviews 
for albums - this is an excellent resource for music information 
retrieval researchers that are interested in data mining the words that 
surround the music.&nbsp; The only thing RYM lacks is a good web api to 
make it easy to extract the reviews for a specific album.<br></p>

			<h3><a href="foosic_-_the_living_music.html" title="permalink">Foosic - the living music database</a></h3>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://www.foosic.org/index.php"><img src="support_files/foosic_header_logo.html" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"></a><a href="http://www.foosic.org/index.php">Foosic</a> is a barebones <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/">Audioscrobbler</a>
 clone - it is an aggregator for song plays.&nbsp; Foosic provides a 
plugin for a (small) number of players that will send your play history 
back to foosic where they collect this data in a database.&nbsp; Using 
this data, foosic offers charts on popular songs, artists, songs and 
genres and active users.&nbsp; They don't offer any sort of 
recommendations, they don't try to match you up with similar users, they
 don't offer to sell you concert tickets for your favorite bands - all 
foosic does is collect the playing history for lots of people and show 
some very basic charts.</p><p>In some ways, I like the singularity of 
purpose of foosic - going to one of the leading Music 2.0 sites such as 
last.fm, iLike or qloud - is like going to Yahoo - there are twenty 
things on the home page, all shouting for your attention - going to 
foosic is like going to Google - the page is clean - nothing is shouting
 at you - the things you can do on the site are few and obvious. </p><p>Still,
 for a song play aggregator such as foosic, there has to be a compelling
 reason for people to want to go to the trouble of downloading and 
installing a plugin - I can't see any value a foosic contributor gets 
from foosic beyond seeing summary stats for their listening habits 
(which iTunes can duplicate pretty well), or knowing that they are 
contributing to a larger stats pool.&nbsp; Perhaps foosic will add 
features in the future that will give me a reason for wanting to install
 the plugin.</p><p>Like most companies in this space,&nbsp; foosic faces
 the problem of bad metadata.&nbsp; Songs are mislabeled or missing, 
artists are misspelled - genres are inconsistent.&nbsp; To deal with 
this problem foosic has chosen to develop their own audio fingerprinting
 system - so they can unambiguously identify a track and assign it clean
 metadata.&nbsp; I find it puzzling that they've decided to create their
 own system when the MusicDNS / MusicBrainz system solves their problem 
so handily. Foosic would have a much better chance of cleaning up their 
data with the MusicDNS system - they could resolve each track to a 
MusicBrainz ID and retrieve good clean metadata via the MusicBrainz 
api.&nbsp; Right now, foosic has 6 different spellings for 'Emerson, 
Lake and Palmer' and a dozen or so spellings of 'The Beatles'. </p><p>Despite
 its somewhat low profile, foosic has collected quite a bit of data in 
its first 9 months of operation. It has nearly 4,000 users, nearly 6 
million submissions and data on 1.5 million tracks.&nbsp; According to 
its submission statistics page, foosic is averaging about 9 submissions a
 minute.&nbsp; This is pretty valuable data and foosic will likely be 
able to some interesting things with it.&nbsp; Foosic may have some 
scaling issues though - it takes 20 seconds to bring up the Top Songs 
page. 20 seconds is an eternity on the web.<br></p><p>Foosic isn't the first song play aggregator - <a href="https://last.fm/">Audioscrobbler/last.fm</a> has a 5 year head start, <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/music">Google Music trends</a>
 has a brand name that will attract users - so I have to wonder what 
foosic is going to do to distinguish itself from these other services. 
&nbsp; It is still early days for foosic - I'm interested in seeing 
where it goes.<br></p><p><br></p>
