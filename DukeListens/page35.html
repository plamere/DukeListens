				Apple has just rolled out the '<a href="https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/03/29itunes.html">Complete my album</a>' feature for iTunes.&nbsp; With this feature, Apple will give you a $.99 credit toward the purchase of an album for every song off that album that you've purchased individually.&nbsp; This lets you easily try out a few songs from an album&nbsp; and if you like them you can pick up the rest of the album without paying any penalty.&nbsp; It's a super feature, that will hopefully encourage listeners to move beyond the most popular tracks for an artist to the tracks that may take a while to grow on you.&nbsp; I think Apple should go one step further with this and give you a discount for each additional song you buy on an album: $0.99 for the first track, $0.88 for the second track, $0.77 for the third and so on until you reach $4.95 which should be the cost of the album.

				<p>This morning, I was fixing a bug using Netbeans. &nbsp; Typical cycle: think, type, build, test.&nbsp; However, the changes I made didn't seem to fix the bug.&nbsp; I was nearly 100% sure that I'd identified the problem, but running the test was still showing the failure.&nbsp; So another cycle of think, type, build and test.&nbsp; Still, no dice.&nbsp; Time to add some printlns - think, type, build, test. Woah! none of my debugging prints are showing up - what's going on? Dang!&nbsp; The project I was working on was not my 'main' project in Netbeans. So when I hit build, it built the wrong project, so my changes were never being compiled.&nbsp; </p><p>Netbeans should be smart enough to know that when you have multiple projects open and you are editing some source and you hit build you are likely to want to build the project related to the source that you just edited, and not the project that has no changes.&nbsp; I'm probably bit by this at least once a week.&nbsp; You'd think I'd learn my lesson, but I don't. Sigh.

				<p>There are many web sites on the net that know what I like.&nbsp; Last.fm knows what music I listen to. LibraryThing knows what books I read.&nbsp; The findory knows what&nbsp; type of news I like.&nbsp; Google knows what kind of searches I make.&nbsp; All of this attention data really should <b>belong</b> to me since this is data <b>about</b> me that is generated <b>by</b> me.&nbsp; If I go to the iTunes store I should be able to point them to my last.fm profile so that iTunes can generate better music recommendations.&nbsp; If I go to Amazon, I should be able to carry along my taste in books based on my LibraryThing collection.&nbsp; I should be able to, but right now, I can't.&nbsp; iTunes doesn't know about the 3 years of music taste data that I've accumulated at last.fm, and there's no way for me to tell iTunes about it.&nbsp; What we really need is a way to make our 'attention data' portable - so I can take the data about what I like and take it with me.&nbsp; So when I go to a new music store I don't have to start from scratch describing what I like and don't like.&nbsp; Instead, I can start getting good music recommendations immediately based on my years of accumulated music taste data.&nbsp; Of course there are lots of issues here - privacy, security and portability don't always mix well. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.apml.org/">Attention Profiling Mark-up language</a> working group is working to define a specification for portable attention data, called APML,&nbsp; that will make our attention data portable.&nbsp; The goal is to &quot;boil down all forms of Attention Data - including Browser History, OPML, Attention.XML, Email etc - to a portable file format containing a description of ranked user interests&quot;.</p><p>This is a brand new working group - it is less than a month old - but it includes some interesting members such as representatives from Scouta, BuzzLogic and Digg.&nbsp; The current spec at <a href="http://www.apml.org/spec/APML%20v0.5%20Draft%20Specification%20v0.2.pdf">draft level 0.2</a>&nbsp; is quite thin (really just three pages of content).&nbsp; In particular, the spec doesn't address specific content types (books, music, movies, blogs).&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is a perfect time to jump in and offer to help, particularly in the music space where data about attention and taste are so very important.

  game is to label songs with
  <b>original</b>, yet <b>relevant</b> words and
  phrases that other players <b>agree with</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Of course the game is just a thinly disguised method of collecting data about music. But it is fun, addicting, and the data helps the excellent music tech team at <a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/">LabROSA.</a></p><p><a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/"></a>I'm currently number 4 on the <a href="http://game.majorminer.com/info/leaders">leader board</a>. The neat thing is that your score can go up even when you are not playing as other players select tags that you've already applied. </p><p>The game itself is well designed. I like especially like how the scoring rules work. Once a label has been applied a couple of times, you can't score any more points for that label.&nbsp; Without this rule, you could just type 'rock' for each song without even listening and climb the leader board.&nbsp; The game has a good, minimalistic web design - no Ajax for Ajax sake.&nbsp; All in all, well done - and it will be interesting to see what kind of data Michael collects,&nbsp; and&nbsp; how the MajorMiner tags&nbsp; compare to tags that people apply at last.fm.<br /></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>If you are a college student looking for something to do over the summer, consider applying to the Google Summer of Code.&nbsp; This year Google will pay stipends to&nbsp; a thousand or more students to work on open source projects. &nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, here at Sun we are particularly excited to see <a href="https://code.google.com/soc/opensolaris/about.html">OpenSolaris</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/soc/ooo/about.html">OpenOffice</a> as part of the SoC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are quite a few music-related projects this year at the SoC.&nbsp; Here are some to consider:</p><ul><li><a href="https://code.google.com/soc/clam/about.html" rel="nofollow">CLAM ( at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra)</a> - CLAM (C++ Library for Audio and Music) is a project that aims at
developing a full-featured application framework for Audio and Music
Applications. It offers a conceptual metamodel as well as many
different tools for that particular domain. One of its most relevant
features is the availability of a visual building dataflow application
that allows to develop rapid prototypes without writing code. <br /></li><li><a href="https://code.google.com/soc/metabrainz/about.html" rel="nofollow">MetaBrainz Foundation</a> - The MetaBrainz Foundation&nbsp; operates the
MusicBrainz Project. MusicBrainz is essentially Wikipedia for music: MusicBrainz is attempting to create a comprehensive user contributed music
encyclopedia. They would like to catalog all music from all ages, all
corners of the world and all ethnic groups. All of their data is freely
downloadable and in the Public Domain and Creative Commons licenses.</li><li><a href="https://code.google.com/soc/xiph/about.html" rel="nofollow">Xiph.org Foundation</a> - Xiph.org is an open source project&nbsp; dedicated
to providing open and free-to-implement multimedia technology as a
foundation for an interoperable, level playing field on the internet
and other digital distribution networks. Over the past 8 years Xiph has
hosted development for all the major patent-free audio and video codec
development, including the Vorbis, Speex, FLAC and Theora, the Ogg
streaming format, and the Icecast streaming media server. <br /></li><li><a href="https://code.google.com/soc/taste/about.html" rel="nofollow">Taste</a> -  Taste is an open-source collaborative filtering engine for Java, hosted on SourceForge.</li><li><a href="https://code.google.com/soc/mixxx/about.html" rel="nofollow">Mixxx</a> - The goal of the Mixxx project is to build a stable, cross-platform,
open source DJ mixing application suitable for amateur and live
professional use.</li><li><a href="https://code.google.com/soc/xmms2/about.html" rel="nofollow">XMMS2</a> - XMMS2 is the spiritual successor to the very successful XMMS project.</li><li><a href="https://code.google.com/soc/amp/about.html" rel="nofollow">Audacious Media Player</a> -  Audacious is a successor to Beep Media Player, a GTK2 port of XMMS. </li><li><a href="https://code.google.com/soc/rockbox/about.html" rel="nofollow">Rockbox</a> -  The Rockbox project started in december 2001 and in it they develop a complete
portable music player firmware replacement - including operating system, GUI
and application suite. Rockbox runs on a wide range of support platforms
including players from Archos, Apple (ipod), iriver, iAudio, Toshiba and
SanDisk</li><li><a href="https://code.google.com/soc/ardour/about.html" rel="nofollow">Ardour</a> -  Ardour is a 7 year old project to implement a professional quality digital audio workstation for POSIX-like operating systems.</li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://code.google.com/soc/ffmpeg/about.html">FFmpeg</a> - Fmpeg is the premiere open source multimedia processing backend
library, highly ubiquitous though rarely directly seen. Dozens if not
hundreds of open source and proprietary software programs are either
known or suspected to incorporate FFmpeg for heavy multimedia lifting.</li><li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://code.google.com/soc/iem/about.html">IEM - Institute of Electronic Music and Acoustics, Graz&nbsp;</a> - concentrates mainly in digital signal
processing, audio engineering, and psycho acoustics, eg. projects in
analysis and syntheses of sound and loudness perception. <br /></li></ul>
