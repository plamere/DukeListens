				<p><b>#3 Yahoo didn't buy last.fm </b>- for a while it seemed that 
Yahoo was going to buy all of the Web 2.0 companies. They bought Flickr.
 They bought Deli.cio.us.&nbsp; It seemed quite natural that the next 
thing they would buy would be venerable (in the web sense) 
Last.FM.&nbsp; Last.FM is one of the first of the Music 2.0 companies - 
they have been collecting all sorts of really interesting data - social 
tags,&nbsp; user song plays.&nbsp; Over the last 4 years they've 
collected billions of data points about music taste.&nbsp; This data can
 be used for all sorts of things: recommendations, identifying 
tastemakers , novel playlist generation, spotting the next breakout 
band.&nbsp;&nbsp; So with Yahoo seemingly buying every Web 2.0 company 
it could, it seemed only natural that Last.FM would join the Yahoo 
empire.&nbsp; But instead, there was the <a href="https://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB116379821933826657-0mbjXoHnQwDMFH_PVeb_jqe3Chk_20061125.html">Peanut butter manifesto</a>
 about Yahoo spreading itself too thin.&nbsp; Yahoo was having a hard 
time figuring out how to monetize its Flickr and Del.icio.us 
acquisitions. The social music space was getting crowded with newcomers 
launching every other month.&nbsp; At the end of the year, Last.fm was 
still an independent company - it still was the largest social music 
network with <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2006/11/pandora_vs_last.html">5 million unique visitors per month</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Now&nbsp; the maturing last.fm has to figure out how to use those 
eyeballs and all that golden data into to stay ahead of the pack - 
without the help of a company like Yahoo.<br></p>

                Peanut butter manifesto aside, Yahoo never seems to do 
the right thing.  Last.fm would have been a great acquisition, instead 
they keep looking at companies like facebook, who they'd just drill into
 the ground.

                These "Things that Didn't Happen" are all really good, 
Paul.  I think that there are many of us in the Music IR community 
(others I've worked with over the years have confided similar thoughts 
to me) that collectively wonder why more of these things that we have 
been working on for years have not taken off yet.  We all saw, years 
ago, the potential for this type of research and technology.  And who 
doesn't like music, right?  So why have the major players collectively 
failed to innovate in this sphere?

I can only think that it has something to do with digital rights, though
 for the life of me I can't figure out what.. given that both Apple and 
Yahoo (and MS for that matter, though maybe to a lesser extent) all seem
 like they have a reasonable working relationship with the music 
companies.  

Perhaps there is some sort of analogy that could be made between MIR and
 cell phone applications?  For years now people have been predicting the
 opening up of cell phones, for general applications, web browsing, etc.
  Yet to this day there remains little to no innovation in that sphere, 
too.  My only guess is that the cell phone companies want to maintain 
their walled gardens, and can actively stifle any innovation that may 
arise.  Maybe there is some similar stifling from the music companies 
towards Yahoo and Apple and MS.  

I know, it doesn't really make sense to me either, because you would 
think that technology that allows fans to discover more/new music would 
increase sales, and make the music companies happy.  But maybe they are 
still too stuck on their old distribution models.  Even though they 
would make more money with newer, long-tail discovery search technology,
 they fear the loss of control, and thus are somehow requiring anyone 
who wants to partner with them (Apple, Yahoo, etc.) to certain, limited 
discovery modes.

I don't know.  Thoughts?  Do you have an analysis of why nothing has 
happened, again, in 2006?  (I remember thinking 2004 was going to be the
 year it all took off).  Would you post your thoughts, after you get to 
#5?
