			<h2>Pandora podcast</h2>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<br>This week on the <a href="http://thisweekintech.com/itn6" target="_self">Inside the net podcast</a> is an interview with Tim Westergren of <a href="https://pandora.com/" target="_self">Pandora.</a>&nbsp;
 Pandora is a content-based music recommender/music streamer.&nbsp; In 
the interview, Tim enthusiastically describes how the Pandora and the 
underlying music genome project works.&nbsp; According to TIm, at 
Pandora, they have about 40 musicians that spend their days labelling 
songs with about 400 different attributes.&nbsp; It takes about 20 to 30
 minutes for their trained musician to rate a song, and they are 
currently adding about 7,000&nbsp; songs a month. After six years, 
Pandora has amassed labels for hundreds of thousands of songs and can do
 a find job of recommending music based upon similarity.&nbsp; However, 
they do have difficulties with scale.&nbsp; They are only able to add a 
very small fraction of new music each year and have to pick and choose 
which songs get added to their database.&nbsp; They skip some genres 
completely. For instance, there is no Classical music in Pandora.&nbsp; 
One of the advantages of a content-based recommender like Pandora has 
over the more traditional collaborative filtering models used in systems
 like <a href="https://www.last.fm/" target="_self">last.fm</a> is that 
they are immune to the popularity bias that is found in the 
collaborative filtering systems.&nbsp; A content-based system is just as
 likely to recommend a garage band as it is to recommend the Beatles, 
since it is immune to popularity, whereas a collaborative filtering 
system that is based upon user listening patterns is much more likely to
 ignore the unknown bands. They don't recommend unknown bands because no
 one is listening to them.&nbsp; Content-based recommenders can push 
listeners into the <a href="https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html" target="_self">long tail</a>
 of music, finding unknowns that sound like music we already like.&nbsp;
 Unfortunately for Pandora, the scaling problem makes them less likely 
to be able push people into the long tail. Pandora has to pick and chose
 which songs to process, and they will start with the most popular songs
 first, so they really can't push people too far into the long tail 
(yet).&nbsp; Despite these issues, Pandora is really good way to explore
 and discover new music.&nbsp; It is worth trying, and since it relies 
on&nbsp; flash, it runs on just about any platform out there..&nbsp; <br><br><br>

                AMG's Tapestry is similar to Pandora except they seem to
 have a much larger number of songs.  Also, Tapestry is the only engine I
 have used that allows for playlists to be created by "Themes" such as 
"Christmas Party",  "Romantic Evening", "Road Trip", or many others. <p>
