          I'm currently reading the excellent book <i>Freedom of Expression: 
          Overzealous Copyright Bozos and Other Enemies of Creativity</i> by 
          Kembrew McLeod. The overarching theme is how current copyright law 
          has been taken over by corporate types and instead of promoting the 
          creation of new work, stifles it. Here's an excerpt about what 
          happened to the Verve when they sampled 5 notes from a Rolling 
          Stones song:

          </span>
<ul>
<quote></quote>
</ul>
<span>
          
<i>The Verve, a popular British band that scored a major worldwide 
          hit in 1997 with “Bittersweet Symphony.” The Verve negotiated a 
          license to use a five-note sample from an orchestral version of one 
          of the Rolling Stones’ lesser hits, “The Last Time,” and received 
          clearance from Decca Records. After “Bittersweet Symphony” became a 
          hit single, the group was sued by former Stones manager Allen Klein 
          (who owns the copyrights to the band’s pre-1970 songs because of 
          aggressive business practices). He claimed the Verve broke the 
          agreement when they supposedly used a larger portion than was 
          covered in the license, something the group vehemently disputed. </i>

          
</span>
<p>
<span>
            
<i>The Verve layered nearly fifty tracks of instrumentation, 
            including novel string arrangements, to create a distinctly new 
            song. In fact, the song’s signature swirling orchestral melody was 
            recorded and arranged by the Verve; the sample from the 
            instrumental record is largely buried under other tracks in the 
            chorus. The band eventually settled out of court and handed over 
            100 percent of their songwriting royalties because it seemed 
            cheaper than fighting for a legal ruling that might not end in 
            their favor. As if things couldn’t have gotten worse, they were 
            then sued by another old Rolling Stones manager, Andrew Loog 
            Oldham. Klein went after the Verve for infringing on the 
            songwriting copyright, which he owned, but Oldham possessed the 
            copyright on the sampled sound recording. They totally lost 
            everything. </i>
          
</span>
</p>
<span>
          
</span>
<p>
<span>
            
<i>Not only couldn’t the Verve earn money from their biggest hit, 
            they were stripped of control of their song. For instance, after 
            the group refused Nike’s request to use “Bittersweet Symphony” in 
            an ad, the shoe manufacturer aired the song after it purchased a 
            license from Allen Klein. “The last thing in the world I wanted 
            was for one of my songs to be used in a commercial,” the 
            despondent lead vocalist Richard Ashcroft said. “I’m still sick 
            about it.” In one final kick in the groin, “Bittersweet Symphony” 
            was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Song category, which honors 
            songwriters. Because the unfavorable settlement transferred the 
            Verve’s copyright and songwriting credit to Klein and the Rolling 
            Stones, the Grammy nomination went to “Mick Jagger and Keith 
            Richards.” Ashcroft quipped that it was “the best song Jagger and 
            Richards have written in twenty years.” He then suffered from a 
            nervous breakdown and the group broke up. </i>

                What a sorry state of affairs for the Verve. Not only 
were they kicked after they were taken down, twice, to top it all off, 
something that has bothered me for a long time only because I can't 
stand the person responsible - Rush Limbaugh has been using the song as 
the unoffical soundtrack to his maniacal misinformation and subliminal 
brainwashing broadcasts as if it were his personal anthem. Can't stand 
that hypocritical loser-scum bag. Is his show required to pay any 
royalties or licensing fees to continually play snippets of that song at
 will or does Broadcast-One have enough clout to be able to do what it 
wants and ask permission later? I would be so pissed if I were Ashcroft.
 He should get in touch with NEGATIVLAND to mount a counter attack to 
expose these pop music pirates for the parasitic scum they are. I myself
 being a non-professional musician will continue to sample everything I 
can see and hear for my own amusement until I am wealthy enough to 
distribute my music freely to everyone on a scale large enough to piss 
off enough executives resulting in a rabid frenzy of frivolous 
litigation and public humiliation while I sit back and laugh at the fact
 that it doesn't take much money for a rich person to sample, remix, 
produce and distribute free music full of copyrighted material without 
having to even begin to try and understand fair use. Can I do that as 
long as I don't profit from it? I would release the whole catalog of 
BMI, Elektra, WB and others on my own label for free. You could print 
advertising on the packaging and sell the ad space to pay for the 
venture. If you are interested in hearing more ideas like this, email 
me. <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="92f7f5f3e7e1fcf7fefed2e5e1fbbfe2e0fde5f7f0e1e6e7f6fbfdbcf1fdffbc">[email&#160;protected]</a> I'm a genius.
