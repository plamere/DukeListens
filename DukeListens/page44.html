		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="http://snappradio.com/">Snapp Radio </a>is a mashup of 
last.fm and flickr - it serves up flickr images based on the mood and 
the theme of the song.&nbsp; In general, it does a good job of giving 
you songs that are related to mood or theme of the song.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, this means that sometimes, the pictures that get served 
up can be rather raunchy - start listening to some old time grungy 
blues, or punk and sooner or later you'll be seeing pictures that are 
definitely not safe for work.&nbsp; When I started this project I was 
under the impression that Flickr was pretty much a PG-13 venue - but 
since working on Snapp Radio I've learned that it sometimes veers into 
the R or even NC-17 territory.&nbsp; And so I needed to write a&nbsp; 
porn filter. &nbsp;</p><p>The first thing I learned about writing a porn
 filter is that it is rather inconvenient to do this at work.&nbsp; 
Here's the work flow:</p><ul><li>Fire up snapp radio</li><li>Start listening to some suspect music (punk usually does it)</li><li>Watch the pictures <br></li><li>Wait for a Not-Safe-For-Work picture (it won't be long)</li><li>When one arrives, click on it to bring up the Flickr page for the picture so you can examine the tags to add them to the filter</li></ul><p>At
 this point it is likely that one of your colleagues (Nicole or Joan 
perhaps), will walk into your office to chat - and notice that your 
screen is covered with some questionable photos,&nbsp; the punk music is
 blaring and you have a sheepish look on your face.&nbsp; What to do?<br></p><p>After
 suffering through such embarrassments I eventually compiled a list of 
words that I can use to filter out most NSFW images - keeping snapp 
radio safe for all those work&nbsp; bound music listeners.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>

				Netbeans 5.5 has a whole bunch of new features designed to help build web services.&nbsp; <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/">Roumen Stroble</a>
 has put together a 30 minute flash demo showing how to use the netbeans
 platform to build a web app&nbsp; that includes a web client, web 
service and database - it is really a great demo of how far the tools 
have come to help building these web apps.&nbsp; I think the speed of 
development for a web service using netbeans now rivals that of Ruby on 
Rails or some of the other agile web frameworks. (Despite what <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/11/10/Comparing-Frameworks">Tim Bray says</a>).&nbsp; Check out the demo at the netbeans site here: <a href="https://netbeans.org/download/flash/platform_55/platform_ws/">Building Applications with Netbeans 5.5</a>

				<p>One of the nifty new features of iTunes 7.0 is that it is now 
tracking
'skip count' - the number of times that a song has been skipped (a song 
is skipped when the 'next song' button is used to advance to the next 
song before the song has completed).&nbsp; The skip count
opens up all sorts of playlisting possibilities -&nbsp; for instance, 
now you can create smart playlists that always avoid songs that have 
been skipped more than 3 times. <br></p><p>There are some examples of 
using the skip count to create interesting smart playlists (and some 
other types of playlists) in this entry at 43 folders:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/11/10/smart-playlists-for-packrats/#more-783">5 Tricks for packrats and power users</a>.&nbsp;  <br></p>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In order to learn a bit about the (so called) web 2.0 technologies, I wrote a web mashup of <a href="https://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> and <a href="http://radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> (an internet radio station)&nbsp; called <b><a href="http://snappradio.com/">Snapp Radio</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Snapp
 Radio is internet radio for the eyes.&nbsp; While you listen to music 
from last.fm or Radio Paradise, Snapp Radio shows you pictures that are 
related to what you are listening to.&nbsp; Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork<a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/39527/Column_Column_Get_That_Out_Of_Your_Mouth_30"> succinctly describes</a> snapp radio:</p><blockquote><p>Put
simply, it's a slideshow tied to an internet radio station: As you listen to a
song, Snapp rolls a series of photos that have some connection to the
music-- whether it's a shot of the band, an image tied to the name of the song,
or just a response to a theme or a mood. 

</p><p>
When
the Clash's "Trains in Vain" starts playing, you see the kind of images you'd
expect-- the band on tour, and a collection of punk and new wave pins on a worn
leather jacket.  Then you see street
riots, police beating protesters, and some kind of battle, followed by a
portrait of President George W. Bush smiling beside Karl Rove-- and then you get a photo
of a garrish living room set that doesn't match the wallpaper: the furniture is
"clashing."  That's right, the software
has a sense of humor, and when the next song comes up and it's the Allman Brothers?  You see a photo of a racoon playing an
upright bass.</p></blockquote><p>Snapp Radio works by collecting 
information about the song, artist and album along with the social tags 
that last.fm listeners have attached and using this information to 
search flickr for images that are related to the music. Some images are 
concrete - concert photos of the band - while others are much more 
abstract -&nbsp; it all depends on the tags.</p><p>Here are some screen 
shots of Snapp Radio - but it is really best experienced live - so if 
you are at a computer where you can listen to streaming music, head on 
over to <a href="http://snappradio.com/">Snapp Radio</a>, fire up an audio stream from last.fm or Radio Paradise and enjoy the show.</p><p align="center"><a href="http://support_files/sr7.png"><img src="support_files/sr7.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="800"></a><br></p><p align="center">&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/resource/sr5.png"> <img src="./page44_files/sr5.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="800"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/plamere/resource/sr4.png"><img src="./page44_files/sr4.png" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="800"></a>&nbsp;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Chris Dahlen's latest column in Pitchfork:&nbsp;<a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/39527/Column_Column_Get_That_Out_Of_Your_Mouth_30"> Fire the Critics</a>
 attempts to predict the future of music criticism - trying to answer 
the question of where professional criticism will fit in to a 
world&nbsp; filled with millions of music bloggers, music discovery 
engines and social tagging (which in some sense is just a music&nbsp; 
review boiled down to a single word).&nbsp; Chris uses <a href="http://snappradio.com/">Snapp Radio</a>
 as an example of what the future of music criticism will look 
like.&nbsp; Just as Snapp Radio can draw on the 'wisdom of the crowds' 
to select images that fit in with music - people will draw on the wisdom
 of the crowds to&nbsp; discover and to be surprised by new music.&nbsp;
 Chris says: 'the responses of thousands of people are going to surprise
 me more than
a handful of people in a magazine office'.

Chris does say there is still room for the professional critic. The 
critic's role now is writing <i>real</i> criticism - compelling, 
original, well-argued writing -&nbsp; to challenge the buzz, to demand 
more from the artists and the listeners,&nbsp; to <a href="https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.09/pitchfork.html?pg=2&amp;topic=pitchfork&amp;topic_set=">'stir up trouble</a>'.

				I'm writing this blog post from the Anne Marie House - this is 
'transitional housing'&nbsp; for families with&nbsp; young children that
 have no home.&nbsp; Currently Anne Marie House is hosting 6 families - 
including 7 children (4 under the age of one year old).&nbsp; Anne Marie
 House is run by the <a href="http://www.gnihn.org/index.php">Greater Nashua Interfaith Hospitality Network</a>,
 an organization of the various local houses of worship (of all faiths).
 The goal is to provide safe, clean, substance free housing for homeless
 families, especially those with young children.&nbsp; The house is run 
by volunteers from the participating churches and temples - the 
volunteers provide meals, hosting, security, organization - everything a
 small hotel would need.&nbsp; So every 6 weeks or so I volunteer to 
spend an night at the house as an overnight host. And let me tell you, 
as far as volunteer jobs, this is a pretty easy one.&nbsp; There's wifi 
(thus the blog), a clean bed (bring your own sheets), and lots of smiles
 from the kids who are staying here.&nbsp; This is a great community 
effort - hundreds of volunteers rotate through this house every month- 
and it really is making a difference is hundreds of lives - especially 
kids who would not have a place to sleep otherwise. &nbsp;

				I updated my laptop this week to Ubuntu Dapper - and now for the 
first time ever, I have a laptop that not only suspends - but resumes as
 well.&nbsp;&nbsp; With&nbsp; my version of Ubuntu (Hoary), my laptop 
would only suspend - the resume function left as an exercise for the 
user.&nbsp; And of course without a resume, the suspend is quite a bit 
less useful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I'm enjoying the new suspend function - I 
started rebuilding a local copy of the musicbrainz database this morning
 from my home office. It was in the middle of a lengthy indexing 
operation when it was time for me to drive in - so I just suspended the 
laptop and stuck in the bag - when I got to work I just fired it up and 
it kept on working ... now I know this is no big thing for all you Mac 
and Windows laptop users but for me its a really big deal &lt;borat&gt;

				<p>Over at <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/09/ilike-adds-music-videos-from-youtube/">techcruch</a> I see that <a href="http://www.ilike.com/">iLike</a>
 has added YouTube videos to their website.&nbsp; Click on a song and 
you not only get the option to preview an audio clip or buy the song 
from iTunes or Amazon - you can now watch a related YouTube video.&nbsp;
 That's pretty cool. I think these sorts of things really help the music
 exploration process.&nbsp;</p><p>I wonder, however, if iLike has made an arrangement with YouTube. Their usage of YouTube videos seems to violate the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms">YouTube terms of service</a>:</p><p></p><blockquote><i>YouTube provides an "Embeddable Player" feature, which you may
incorporate into your own personal, non-commercial websites for use in
accessing the materials on the Website, provided that you include a
prominent link back to the YouTube website on the pages containing the

 me that iLike's site is a commercial website (presumably they are 
making money - perhaps via iTunes/Amazon referrals) which would violate 
the non-commerial TOS (nevermind that they don't have the prominent link
 back to YouTube).&nbsp; So perhaps they have a commercial arrangement 
with YouTube - or perhaps they are just hoping to fly under YouTube's 
radar.&nbsp;  <br><p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>For the longest time, I was a vi/make or vi/ant guy.&nbsp; Vi 
(really VIM) did everything I needed when writing software.&nbsp; Plus, 
25 years of typing in VI really ingrains the finger macros.&nbsp; About a
 year ago I made the switch to Netbeans - and I must say that it really 
is a superior environment to the old standby.&nbsp; (I'll miss you vi-my
 old friend, sniff) . </p><p>&nbsp;Netbeans does a great job of 
supporting the build environment for a web application. It manages all 
of the complicated deployment descriptors for you and neatly builds a 
war file that you can deploy to your app server.&nbsp; It is very easy 
to build and deploy these web apps.</p><p>&nbsp;Yesterday, I was making a
 minor change to my web mashup - a change to a constant in the code, and
 some updates to some HTML.&nbsp;&nbsp; I built the war file, tested it 
inside netbeans - everything worked fine - and then deployed it to the 
external web server - uh oh - no dice - the main page of the web app was
 only partially loaded, strange javascript errors on the console, 
nothing is working.&nbsp; Good thing I had a back up of the previous war
 file - I uploaded the old version and it worked just fine.</p><p>Now to
 debug this ... since the changes were incredibly minor I couldn't 
fathom what was causing the problem, add to that the fact that the app 
ran fine when tested locally.&nbsp; I suspected a corrupt war file - so I
 built a new one from scratch and deployed it - same problem.&nbsp; 
Argh!&nbsp; - time to widen the search.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now one major change
 was that I did a reinstall of my OS on my laptop (my primary 
development environment) - so I had a fresh copy of Netbeans and the JDK
 - perhaps this was the problem - and then there was that magic <b><i>click</i></b>
 that occurs in the programmer brain when everything all falls into 
place and the solution to the problem becomes clear.&nbsp; It's the <i>aha!</i>
 moment that makes programming so much fun.&nbsp; Of course the problem 
was that I was building with the latest and greatest JDK 1.6 - while my 
web server is running a version of Tomcat running under Java 1.5 - way 
down deep I was receiving class loading errors due to the incompatible 
classes (you can't run bytecodes compiled with 1.6 under a 1.5 
VM).&nbsp; A quick install of JDK 1.5, a rebuild of the war file - a 
quick deploy - yep! everything's working now.</p><p>This has to be a 
fairly common error - and it seems that it would be fairly simple for 
tomcat to detect - it certainly would have saved me time if Tomcat had 
rejected my war file and given me an error message about the Java 
version skew during the deploy.<br></p>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>I've been using the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr web services API</a> for a web mashup.&nbsp; The Flickr API is quite easy to use (especially if you use the <a href="http://flickrj.sourceforge.net/">Flickrj</a> Java API) and as long as you follow the Flickr <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/tos/">terms of service</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
 you&nbsp; are free to take advantage of the API.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the
 terms of service is "You shall not display more than 30 Flickr user 
photos per page in your application or use an unreasonable amount of 
bandwidth." - the tricky bit is the 'unreasonable amount of bandwidth'. 
What may be perfectly reasonable to me, may be not so nice for 
Flickr.&nbsp; Since I need a Flickr&nbsp; Key to use the API,&nbsp; 
Flickr can track my usage of the API, so I've always been a bit worried 
that sooner or later Flickr would decide that I was using an 
unreasonable amount of bandwidth and shut me down.</p><p>Flickr does 
help you track your usage.&nbsp; If you visit your Flickr API key page 
you'll see a link to your usage statistics for each of your API 
keys.&nbsp; On the statistics page Flickr shows you all sorts of 
interesting data about how you've used your key.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;Here's an excerpt of my Flickr key Stats page:<br>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://support_files/flickrkey.gif"><img src="support_files/flickrkey.gif" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" width="80%"></a><br></p><p>Flickr
 is telling me that I'm making about 43,000 calls per day - about one 
every 2 seconds.&nbsp; This matches my back-of-the-envelope 
estimate.&nbsp; The plots are nice as well, showing that I have very 
stable access pattern.&nbsp; The coloring is a bit worrisome - I guess I
 am in the 'red zone'.&nbsp; It looks like if I want to stay under the 
Flickr radar I'll need to cut back my accesses to about 50% of what I'm 
making now.&nbsp;&nbsp; But since they haven't complained yet - we'll 
see how long we can go at the current access rate.</p><p>Flickr has over
 250,000,000 photos, it is an incredible resource - and having an API 
that lets us write apps using the data just makes the Flickr data more 
valuable.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
				According to this <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/11/prweb467083.htm">press release</a> <a href="http://www.soundflavor.com/">SoundFlavor</a> has licensed <a href="http://www.musicdns.org/">MusicDNS</a> -&nbsp; <a href="http://www.musicip.com/">MusicIP's</a>
 audio fingerprinting technology.&nbsp; MusicDNS uses an audio 
fingerprint to unambiguously assign a song id to an audio track, 
eliminating the problems that result from missing, incomplete or wrong 
ID3 tags.&nbsp; I've been hoping for quite a while that a single Song ID
 system will emerge as dominant so that it will be easy for the various 
members of the music ecosystem to work together. It looks like MusicDNS 
is starting to gain some traction - their association with MusicBrainz 
(the open source for music metadata) really helps. &nbsp;&nbsp; Soon 
MusicDNS will hit the tipping point and become <i>the</i> de facto Song ID standard
