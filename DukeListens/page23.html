				<p>The results for the<a href="take_the_music_recommendation_turing.html"> Music Recommender Turing Test</a>
 challenge are in!&nbsp; In this challenge, I posed the question - "Can 
you tell which music recommendation was generated by a human, and which 
was generated by a machine?". &nbsp; Two recommendation lists were 
generated as the response to the question "If you like Miles Davis, you 
might like?". &nbsp; One list was generated by a professional music 
critic, the other by an algorithm develop here in the labs.&nbsp; The 
lists generated were:<br><br><b>Recommendation List A:&nbsp; <br></b></p><p>If you like "Miles Davis" you might like:</p><ol><li>John Coltrane</li><li>Duke Ellington</li><li>Thelonious Monk</li><li>Charlie Parker</li><li>Herbie Hancock</li><li>Bill Evans</li><li>Charles Mingus</li><li>Sonny Rollins <br></li><li>Wayne Shorter</li><li>Weather Report<br></li></ol><p>&nbsp;<b>Recommendation List B:&nbsp; <br>
</b></p><p>If you like "Miles Davis" you might like:</p><ol><li>John Coltrane</li><li>Weather Report</li><li>Herbie Hancock</li><li>Wayne Shorter</li><li>Charlie Parker</li><li>Dave Douglas</li><li>Chet Baker</li><li>Tony Williams Lifetime</li><li>Can</li><li>Sly &amp; the Family Stone <br></li></ol><p>&nbsp;The
 challenge received 29 responses, of which 19 had direct predictions 
(the others opined about the quality of the recommendation or the 
difficulty of the challenge).&nbsp; Of the 19 predictions, the results 
were quite skewed, 15 indicated that they thought that list A was 
created by a human, while 4 thought that list B was created by a 
human.&nbsp; Some respondents were quite sure in their 
predictions:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><pre>"Well, this is too easy...</pre><pre>A = human<br>
B = machine</pre><pre>no doubt in my mind.</pre></blockquote>





<p>Others were less sure:</p><blockquote><pre>I bet B is machine generated, although it's a tough one to call<br></pre></blockquote>


<p>One interesting thing is that although the clear majority thought 
that list A was created by a human, those that indicated a preference, 
seemed to prefer list B.&nbsp; One commenter said&nbsp; "B has 
differences that wouldn't show up in a human's list because a human will
 stick to the genre. That said I think I like B more."</p><p><b>The Results</b></p><p>
 To summarize:&nbsp; 19 indicate that list A is a human, while 4 
indicate that list B is a human.&nbsp;&nbsp; The actual source of the 
lists are: <br></p><ul><li>List A -<b> a machine</b> - an collaborative filtering system developed in Sun Labs based upon last.fm listener data</li><li>List B -<b> a human</b> - a professional music critic named Dominique.</li></ul><p><b>80% of the respondents got the answer wrong.</b> </p><p>BTW,
 Dominique - the music critic responded to the comments as such: "yes, I
 am most certainly a robot!&nbsp; I like the guy who commented about
miles' different eras -- one of the hardest parts about recommending
based on him is trying to figure out what aspect/period of miles davis
people are responding to."<br></p><p> This was a really fun exercise for
 me. The resulting dialog provided many insights into what it takes to 
make a good recommendation.&nbsp; And I find the results to be quite 
surprising, that a rather traditional recommendation algorithm can mimic
 a human enough to convince a significant majority that it is not a 
machine.&nbsp; Perhaps this bodes well for machine recommendation.&nbsp;
 (Of course this experiment is too small and too casual to draw any long
 term conclusions).</p><p><b>And the Winner is ...</b></p><p>Of the 4 
correct answers, I selected one at random to receive my extra copy of 
"Net Blogs and Rock 'N' Roll".&nbsp; The winner could have been David 
Jennings (the author of the book), which would have been an interesting 
twist, but the coin wavered and sent the winning book to 
JuniorBonner.&nbsp; Congrats Junior.<br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				<p>There are lots of music recommenders out there, each one  vying for<br>our attention, trying to connect us to our next favorite band.  But not all<br>recommenders are created equal. Some have the insights and good taste of a<br>Bill Goldsmith or a John Peel, while others seem to have as much insight<br>about what I might like as an iPod on shuffle play. But which<br>recommenders are the best, and which are the worst? And how do these music<br>recommendations compare to what a professional would generate? Can machines<br>compete with humans in what is clearly a question of taste?  A few months<br>ago, I decided to try to answer these questions - to find out what is the<br>best music recommender, and to find out if machines can compete with humans<br>when it comes to recommending music.  Over the next few days, I shall be<br>blogging what I've discovered.<br><br><b>The tough question</b><br><br>The hardest question to answer is 'How to evaluate a recommendation?'.<br>A typical recommendaton starts with a seed artist, so for instance<br>a recommendation may be of the form "If you like The Beatles you may<br>like.. " followed by a list of recommended artists.  Now, when I look a<br>music recommendation based on an artist that I really know, I can get<br>a feel for the quality of recommendation.  In the list of recommended<br>artists, I expect to see some artists that I already am familiar with -<br>probably bands that I like.  Even though these recommendations may<br>be obvious, they help me gain some trust in the recommender. If I<br>ask for a recommendation based on my affinity for Miles Davis and<br>a recommender suggests John Coltrane, I get a warm feeling that the<br>recommender is on the right track.  It is a relevant (albeit somewhat<br>obvious) recommendation. I also expect to see some artists that I've<br>heard of but am not too familiar with, and I also expect to see some<br>artists that I've never heard of.  So for me a good recommendation<br>contains a mix of the familiar (to help me gain trust), and the novel<br>(to help me find new music).  Now of course, if the recommended artists<br>are off track ('if you like Miles Davis you might like Paris Hilton'),<br>no amount of familiarity or novelty is going to turn the recommendation<br>into a good recommendation.  The recommendations need to be relevant.<br>To summarize, a good recommendation has three aspects:<br></p><ul><li>   <b>familiarity</b> - to help us gain trust in the recommender</li><li><b>novelty</b> - without new music, the recommendation is pointless</li><li><b>relevance</b> - the recommended music has to match my taste<br></li></ul><p>Lets look at a couple of recommendation as examples.  Here's a set of<br>similar artist recommendations for The Beatles from last.fm.  According to<br>last.fm, if you like the Beatles you might like:<br></p><ul><li>    The Rolling Stones</li><li>    The Who</li><li>    John Lennon</li><li>    Led Zeppelin</li><li>    Queen</li><li>    Beach Boys</li><li>    Doors</li><li>    David Bowie</li><li>    Kinks<br></li></ul><p>Well, last.fm certainly gets the 'familiar' and the 'relevant', but<br>there's nothing novel here. Any fan of the Beatles has no doubt heard of<br>all of these bands, no great discoveries will be found in this selection.<br><br>Compare those to this set from Dominique, a professional music critic.<br>According to Dominque, if you like the Beatles you might like:<br></p><ul><li>    Paul McCartney/Wings</li><li>    John Lennon</li><li>    Harry Nilsson</li><li>    Queen</li><li>    George Harrison</li><li>    ELO</li><li>    Raspberries</li><li>    Badfinger</li><li>    XTC</li><li>    The Millennium<br></li></ul><p>This list has the familiar and relevant McCartney, Lennon, Harrison<br>and Queen as well as some artists that a typical Beatles fan may not<br>have heard of: The Raspberries and Millennium.  Dominique seems to have<br>restricted his recommendations to bands from the late sixties and early<br>seventies. Not an unreasonable choice, but it does perhaps reduce  the<br>novelty aspect of the recommendations.<br><br>Compare those to this set from Chris, another professional music critic.<br>According to Chris, if you like the Beatles you might like:<br></p><ul><li>    Chuck Berry</li><li>    Harry Nilsson</li><li>    XTC</li><li>    Marshall Crenshaw</li><li>    Super Furry Animals</li><li>    Badfinger</li><li>    The Raspberries</li><li>    The Flaming Lips</li><li>    Jason Faulkner</li><li>    Michael Penn<br></li></ul><p>So there's the familiar with Chuck Berry and Harry Nilsson, but I have to<br>pause and think for a bit about relevance - there's no Rolling Stones or<br>The Who to give me a warm fuzzy feeling, Chris gets to the novel artists<br>right away - high on novelty scale but not high on the familiarity scale<br>(at least for me).<br><br>And finally here's a set of similar artist from the All Music Guide.<br>According to All Music, if you like the Beatles you might like:<br></p><ul><li>    Hollies</li><li>    Searchers</li><li>    Peter and Gordon</li><li>    Monkees</li><li>    Gerry and the Pacemakers</li><li>    Bee Gees</li><li>    Zombies</li><li>    Dave Clark Five</li><li>    Remains</li><li>    Sorrows<br></li></ul><p>This list seems fairly balanced, there's the familiar (Monkees, Bee Gees,<br>Dave Clark Five, and the Hollies), they've avoided the cliches (no Rolling<br>Stones, Queen or the Who) and have some bands that I'm not too familar<br>with including a band called 'The Sorrows' who are described as "one of<br>the most overlooked bands of the British Invasion" which certainly looks<br>like something that'd be fun to listen to if I like the Beatles.<br><br>With these four examples, I've tried to show the three elements<br>that I look for in a good music recommendation: familiarity, relevance<br>and novelty. The difficulty is, of course, that no two people will agree<br>exactly on what is familiar, relevant or novel.  What I find novel, may be<br>familiar to a professional music critic, while a musician may find musical<br>relevance when I don't. The difficult job for a recommender, whether<br>it is human or a machine is to find the proper level of famililarity,<br>novelty and relevance for each person.<br><br>Finally, if we really want to evaluate a number of recommender systems,<br>to compare the quality of recommendations, we have to figure out a good<br>way to turn the very subjective measures that we've looked at here into<br>a set of objective measures that we can use to score recommendations.<br>Part 2 will look at some of the objective ways we will use to evaluate the<br>various music recommenders.<br><br></p>

 Meinard is a member of the Multimedia
		Signal Processing Group at Bonn University, working as
		a researcher and lecturer. Meinard has always been one of my favorite 
ISMIR speakers.&nbsp; His work&nbsp; on score alignment is particularly 
fascinating.&nbsp; </p><p>The publisher of this new book, Springer-Verlag, describes it thus:</p>
<blockquote><i>This monograph details concepts and algorithms for robust and
efficient information retrieval by means of two different types of
multimedia data: waveform-based music data and human motion data. It
first examines several approaches in music information retrieval, in
particular general strategies as well as efficient algorithms. The book
then introduces a general and unified framework for motion analysis,
retrieval, and classification, highlighting the design of suitable
features, the notion of similarity used to compare data streams, and
data organization. The detailed chapters at the beginning of each part
give consideration to the interdisciplinary character of this field,
covering information science, digital signal processing, audio
engineering, musicology, and computer graphics.</i></blockquote><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p>

 with supporting information for the music recommendation 
tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the site you will find PDFs of the slide deck 
(all 250 of them), the the tutorial proposal that we submitted to the 
program committee back in April (I knew I was signing up for a lot of 
work, but I didn't know exactly how much) and some other bits and 
pieces. </p><p>Oscar and I would love to hear some feedback on the 
tutorial - the good and bad bits. (Yes, we had too much material to 
cover in too little time, apologies for talking so fast).&nbsp; We'd 
also like to continue the conversations about what makes a good 
recommendation - in particular the 'relevance + novelty' idea - and how 
it can be measured.&nbsp; So if you have thoughts about this, or 
comments about the tutorial, please add to the comments of this post.</p><p>&nbsp;Finally,
 let me say it was great fun working with Oscar - he's smart, easy going
 and just filled with good ideas.&nbsp; But Oscar learned an important 
lesson - don't over stuff yourself on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnitzel">Weiner shcnitzel</a>,
 the night before&nbsp; a big talk ... you'll not be too happy the next 
day.&nbsp; Here's Oscar, an hour before the tutorial wondering if he'd 
make it through ...</p><p align="center"><img src="support_files/1430956783_3c1283c99d.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" hspace="0" vspace="0"><br></p>

I discovered the Vienna Cafes this week.  Unlike a Starbucks, these 
cafes are places that you can linger. You can talk, work, read or just 
hangout.  It really feels like a different century in some of these. I 
was expecting to see Sigmund Freud walk in at any moment.  It is all 
about pace - and the Vienna Cafe is nice and slow.

				<p>Next Saturday I'll be travelling to Montreal during the Pop Montreal festival.&nbsp; I'm sitting on a panel entitled&nbsp;<strong> Recommendation Engine: Conceptualizing the Universe. </strong>along
 with Sandy Pearlman (record producer), Doug Eck (University of 
Montreal, Music+Machine learning expert) and Brian Whitman (The Echo 
Nest). </p><p>The description of the panel is:</p><p><i>How a full bore recommendation engine would reliably lead anyone in the
world to all the music in the world they would love if they only knew
it existed. With an aggregate of over one billion songs – as opposed to
titles now available somewhere on line (according to Cache Logic),
implementing recommendation engineering navigation, capable of creating
a taste based “trend line” populated by as many songs, version and/or
title that one may specify, simply as a function of a few user inputted
descriptors, would impose individually generated guided availability
upon what would otherwise prove an ungraspable chaos of music overload.
How will recommendation engines rise to the challenge? Some of the
world’s leading technological gurus, futurists, licensing library reps
and recommendation engine leaders discuss one emerging trend in the
future of music<br></i></p><p>Now I don't know what any of that means, 
but I still think the panel would be a good look at what is going on in 
the world of music recommendation, so stop on by if you are in the area.

Last night Elias and Gwen brought a gang of us to the Vienna Opera.  For
 only 2 Euros, you can get a space in the gallery to stand and watch the
 opera.  The gallery is the standing area behind the last seats on the 
top most balcony.  It is an incredible value, since main house seats can
 cost 150 or 200 Euros.  We watched about the first 45 minutes of the 
Barber of Seville.  I really enjoyed the show - the singing and 
orchestra was amazing, the acoustics were excellent (no amplification), 
and the audience was well behaved.  We left before the fat lady sang 
because we really only wanted a taste of the opera, and after standing 
for much of the day we were tired and wanted to sit.  Elias and Gwen 
then brought us to a traditional underground Vienna restaurant, and then
 to a quite cool Vienna cafe.  It was a great night of great 
conversations.  Much thanks to Elias and Gwen for organizing the night 
out.

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Yahoo Research's Malcolm Slaney presented a paper at ISMIR on 
Wednesday about how they are using user rating data to create song 
similarity data. Yahoo is in the enviable position of having billions of
 user-taste data points about music.&nbsp; This data, naturally, can be 
used to generate item to item similarities that would be extremely 
useful as ground truth for any number of MIR tasks.&nbsp; Malcolm's 
motivation for the talk was to propose an alternative to the rather 
time-consuming and painful&nbsp; process of human evaluations that are 
used in the music similarity task in MIREX.&nbsp; Malcolm presented a 
rather traditional item-to-item collaborative filtering system - nothing
 new in the approach, I was hoping that at the end Malcolm would say 
that they are giving a big wad of the taste data or the item-item 
similarity data to the MIR community, but alas, Malcolm says that it is 
just too hard to give away such data - especially after the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/2100-1030_3-6102793.html">AOL shared data fiasco</a> of last year. &nbsp;
