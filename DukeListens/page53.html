 again that Google is getting ready to deploy a music store. This time 
all the rumors come down to the opinions of a single analyst who noticed
 that Google was having a party with the music industry 
executives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Right now, I don't see how a 
Google Music store would make sense.&nbsp; The main market for an online
 music store is to fill all of those digital music players (people don't
 buy music to listen just on their computers anymore - if they ever 
did).&nbsp; The problem for Google is that 85% of the portable music 
players are Apple iPods or shuffles which use Apple's DRM.&nbsp; Apple 
doesn't license their DRM and doesn't like people messing around with it
 (Apple <a target="_self" href="https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20040729-4051.html">threatened</a>
 to invoke the DMCA when RealNetworks tried to get their DRM'd songs to 
play on an iPod). So that leaves Google scraping for the other 15% of 
market that uses Microsoft's PlayForSure DRM. They'd be competing with 
Rhapsody, Yahoo, Walmart, Virgin Digital and just about every other mom 
and pop.&nbsp; There just isn't any marketshare left to make it 
profitable.&nbsp; So how could a Google music store possibly work? Well 
.. here are some ideas:<br>
<ul>
<li>Google makes their own branded iPod clone that they give away to music subscribers (like <a target="_self" href="the_amazon_ipod.html">Amazon is planning</a> to do)<br></li>
<li>Google gives the music away and makes their money selling advertising.</li>
<li>Google provides some really compelling music search and discovery tools that no one else can match.</li>
<li>The courts (or France) forces Apple to license their DRM<br></li></ul>Personally
 I'm most interested in seeing what Google can do when they bring their 
search expertise to bear on the problem of music discovery.<br><br><br>

				<br>If you look as the <a target="_self" href="https://www.last.fm/charts/">last.fm charts</a>,
 you'll see that the song 'Such Great Heights"&nbsp; by the indietronic 
band Postal Service is the number one song.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking a bit 
more closely you'll see that 'such great heights' has been a #1 or near 
#1 for the last six months (it was #2 on <a target="_self" href="https://www.last.fm/charts/overview/1111924801-1112529601">April 3, 2005</a>).&nbsp;
 Now, don't get me wrong, I like the Postal Service, but we're not 
talking 'Dark side of the moon' here (with its 15 years on the Billboard
 200). This is the trouble with social recommenders, they get funny 
feedback loops and incredible inertia. Once something is at #1 on the 
last.fm charts, it is guaranteed to get lots of plays and because of 
that ... it gets to stay #1.&nbsp; Don't be surprised to see 'such great
 heights' at #1 in a year from now, unless last.fm things adjusts their 
model a bit to&nbsp; allow other songs to more easily climb the charts. <br>

				<img src="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/support_files/logo_3306.gif" alt=""><br><br>Finally, a good application for speech recognition ... <a target="_self" href="http://www.podzinger.com/">Podzinger</a>
 uses speech recognition to index podcasts and videocasts, making this 
whole world of spoken audio searchable.&nbsp; When you search on 
Podzinger, podzinger will show the set of podcasts that match your 
query, and even allow you to directly play the content at the point that
 matches your query.&nbsp; It's an audio-based passage retrieval.&nbsp; 
PodZinger is not trying to create transcripts of podcasts, but instead 
to make them searchable. That means the speech recognition doesn't have 
to be 100% accurate (or even 85% accurate), it just has to be good 
enough to get the 'content' words ... which tend to be longer and less 
confusable than all of the typical stop words like 'of', 'a', 'and' and 
'the'.&nbsp; Still, the text passages shown by PodZinger are suprisingly
 understandable, and give you a good idea whether the associated podcast
 is interesting enough to warrant a listen.<br><br>PodZinger also has a feature called '<a target="_self" href="http://www.podzinger.com/ZingIndex.jsp">the ZING index</a>
 which is like the Google Zeitgeist.&nbsp; It reports on who and what is
 being talked about most of all on podcasts.&nbsp; Dick Cheney is 
topping this week's Zing Index.<br><br>The key to success for such an 
ambitious project is the quality of the speech engine.&nbsp; Speaker 
independent, continuous speech recognition of spontaneous speech 
(especially with multiple speakers, background music and noise) is very 
difficult.&nbsp; Add to that the scaling problems ... trying to process 
50,000 hours of speech in a week takes a lot of CPU time.&nbsp; This is 
not a problem that I'd expect a small startup company like PodZinger to 
be able to tackle, but it turns out PodZinger is not really a small 
startup ... its tied to the venerable BBN, the research contractor that 
has a long history of developing speech recognition engines.&nbsp; BBN 
certainly has the know-how to deal with these issues.&nbsp; <br>

last.fm is that they've figured out how to <b class="moz-txt-star"><span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span>implicity<span class="moz-txt-tag">*</span></b> measure what you 
like by watching what you&nbsp; are playing.. since I just put on the song 
'december' by weezer, last.fm can infer that I must like it (at least a 
little bit) and bump up my preference score.&nbsp; Now what this mashup is 
doing is feeding last.fm with what Pandora plays not what I play. After doing this for 
a while last.fm will have learned what Pandora's preferences are and not 
mine.&nbsp; Imagine if every last.fm user was doing this, eventually last.fm's 
social recommender would have learned what Pandora prefers and will have

jobs.&nbsp; Perfect for domains like music information retrieval where a
 single analysis pass on a large music collection could take years of 
CPU time.&nbsp; Instead of waiting&nbsp; years for the job to complete, 
the job can be put on the grid and completed in a weekend.&nbsp; Good 
Stuff.&nbsp; <br><br>I spent some time a few months ago figuring out 
what it would take to get our music analysis software to run on the 
grid.&nbsp; The main question I needed to answer was "What do I need to 
do to my big hunk of java code to get it to run well on the Sun Grid so 
that I could take advantage of all of resources of the Grid"&nbsp; The 
answer, I discovered, was that there were no Java APIs for writing 
software for the grid and getting my Java app to run on the grid was 
going to be a bit of work.&nbsp; <br><br>The good news is that there's a
 group in Sun that is trying to fix this, to make sure that Java works 
and works well on the Sun Grid. This week these folks have issued an 
early access release of the '<a href="https://computeserver.dev.java.net/" target="_self">Compute Server</a>'
 (catchy name, isn't it?).&nbsp; The goal for the compute server is to 
create an environment for Java programmers so that they can easily use 
the Sun Grid Compute utility.&nbsp; The compute server provides an 
extremely simple API for a distributing computation across a large 
number of CPUs and gathering feedback and results from the 
computation.&nbsp;&nbsp; The compute server is integrated with NetBeans,
 so deploying a job to the grid is part of the development work 
flow.&nbsp; Here's a diagram that shows how the process works:<br><img alt="" src="https://kiserai.net/DukeListens/support_files/csdiagram.gif"><br><br>Remember, this is an early access release. The goal is to get feedback from developers.&nbsp; You can <a target="_self" href="https://computeserver.dev.java.net/downloads/computeserver0_1.zip">download</a>
 the early access compute server and look at the code (there's some good
 examples including a grid-enabled program that calculates the digits of
 PI in just a couple of hundred lines of code).<br><br>I've had the 
lucky opportunity to talk with the&nbsp; developers building the compute
 server and have been quite impressed. These are&nbsp; some really smart
 programmers with lots of&nbsp; experience building distributed systems 
in Java.&nbsp; I have high hopes for the compute server.<br><br><br>
