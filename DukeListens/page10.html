				Jennie  has written up a <a href="https://uncrownedroyalty.blogspot.com/2008/07/lastfm.html">blog review of Last.fm</a>,
 in particular how Last.fm uses tags to help make recommendations - she 
shows the tag cloud for the Jonas Brothers and even points out that the 
Jonas Brothers is getting tag-spammed with metal. 
<p>
I think she's getting ready to do a few slides about hacking and social tags at the <a href="social_tags_and_mir_a.html">tutorial</a> that Elias and I are giving at ISMIR this year.  That takes some of pressure off me for sure.
</p><p>
I also noticed that in her post she cleaned up the language in the tags.
  Pop artists tend to attract the haters that enjoy tagging vandalism. 
The Jonas Brothers tag cloud is filled with words that a typical Jonas 
Brother fan should not be exposed to. Perhaps, Last.fm needs a safe-tags
 setting to filter out the  profanities so my 13 year old daughter 
doesn't have to.
</p><p>
My colleague, Steve is always bragging about how he's a <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/searchguy/entry/hey_check_out_my_dad">second generation searchguy</a>
 (his Dad did IR on punch cards). But now I can top him with my second 
generation music folksonomist progeny. In your face, Steve!

 is that every tag that ever has been applied by Last.fm users to music 
now has its own page that contains everything Last.fm knows about the 
tag. The page shows the top artist for the tag, a wiki-style description
 of the tag, and a shoutbox where last.fm listeners can have a running 
conversation about the tag.  The shoutbox seems like it will be a lot of
 fun - it's the place to go if you want to argue the finer points of <a href="https://www.last.fm/tags/technical+death+metal">technical death metal</a> vs. <a href="https://www.last.fm/tags/melodic+death+metal">melodic death metal</a>. The current dialog in the <a href="https://www.last.fm/tag/emo/">emo shoutbox</a> is particularly entertaining as fans try to protect their listening turf. Some selections:
<ul>
<li> And what is it with everyone with the same goddamn haircut!
</li><li>Haha, it says Iron Maiden is emo. 
</li><li>'Flex94 tagged My Chemical Romance as ‘emo’.'What the hell is that.?
</li><li>    James Blunt and Iron Maiden emo?! O.o
</li><li> OMG!! some people really don't know what is emo and how it 
sounds.... AFI, FOB, Blink182, Bullet for my valentine, Good Charlotte, 
Sum41, Placebo, Him, 3DG, Nirvana, Slipknot, 50cent... - EMO??? WOW... 
X_x some listeners are really stupid! 
</li></ul>
This is all getting a bit meta - people commenting on tags that other 
people apply to music. Maybe we can take this a bit further and let 
people moderate the comments that people are making about the tags that 
others are applying to the music. And then we can have meta-moderators 
to moderate the moderators ... ow - my head hurts.

				2008 is looking to be the year that researchers start paying attention to social tags in a big way.  At the recent AAAI <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/itwp08/program.html">Workshop on Intelligent Techniques for Web Personalization and Recommender systems</a>, one third of the talks were devoted to social tagging topics.  <a href="http://www.iua.upf.es/%7Eocelma/">Oscar</a> tells me that 5 out of the 30 papers at the upcoming<a href="http://recsys.acm.org/program.html#paper"> RecSys 08</a> are devoted to social tagging topics.
<p>
This year's <a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/">ISMIR</a> will be no 
different. There's lots of interesting research around tags and music 
information retrieval -  researchers are looking at filling out the tag 
cloud (autotagging and tagging games), extracting information from tags 
(latent semantic methods), cleaning up tags,  using tags to assist in 
training of classifiers, using tags for recommendation, discovery and 
exploration. There seems to be no end to the interesting things we can 
do with social tags.
</p><p>
At this year's <a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/">ISMIR</a>, Elias Pampalk and I will be presenting a <a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/tutorials">tutorial</a>
 on social tags and music.  In the tutorial we will be looking at the 
state-of-the-art in commercial and research systems that use social 
tags. I'm rather excited about the tutorial - the topic is just so 
fascinating to me - and it is great to work with Elias especially with 
his deep knowledge of the last.fm tagging data (and his new found <a href="https://mir-research.blogspot.com/2008/07/recommended-book-probability-and.html">statistical expertise</a>). 
</p><p>
If you are attending ISMIR this year and have an interest in social tags, consider signing up for the tutorial.

 One of the problems that plagues recommender systems is the New User 
problem - how do you give recommendations to  someone who has just come 
to your site for the first time?  Well, you could ask them lots of 
questions about themselves, but that can be off-putting, most folks 
don't want to wait even 3 seconds for a web page, how can you expect 
them to fill out an extensive questionnaire describing their likes and 
dislikes? You could just ignore the problem and generate recommendations
 based upon the slimmest of data, like a single favorite artist. Or you 
could just recommend what is popular.  But you run the risk of 
alienating your new visitor with these generic, non-personalized 
recommendations.
<p>
It would be nice if people carried around some representation of their 
taste so when they visited a new site, they could get good 
recommendations right away. This certainly would be good for the 
individual - they would be spared from having to re-enter all of their 
preference data every time they visit a new site - and it would be great
 for every web startup that wants to make sure they deliver the most 
appropriate content to their visitors, even for first  time visitors.
</p><p>
There are a number of attempts to create a representation for portable taste data. There's the <a href="http://apml.org/">Attention Profile Markup Language (APML)</a>, there's the <a href="http://www.matchmine.com/matchkey/">Matchkey</a>.  Now there's one more - <a href="http://www.opentaste.net/">OpenTaste</a>.
  OpenTaste an open standard for making your online persona portable. 
OpenTaste profiles allow you to capture your preferences, store them 
online, and share them --- or not --- with OpenTaste-enabled websites. 
Technically speaking OpenTaste is a open protocol standard based on 
OAuth and OpenID that enables the markup of preference semantics in 
RDF/XML, XML, and HTML with microformats.  In some ways you can look at 
OpenTaste as APML with semantics. The XML version of OpenTaste even uses
 APML syntax to represent explicit and implicit attention, but then 
layers analysis models for attention and preferences, along with 
semantic relationships to ensure that the concepts are clear and 
unambiguous.
</p><p>
OpenTaste is a new effort being spearheaded by <a href="http://www.strands.com/">strands</a> - the <a href="http://www.opentaste.net/overview.html">site</a> has just gone live, with specifications, examples and schemas. More info is promised in the  <a href="http://blog.opentaste.net/">OpenTaste blog</a>.
  Given that one of the categories on the blog is 'W3C' - it looks like 
OpenTaste may be going the formal standard route.  Soon, perhaps there 
will be standard way of specify portable taste data - solving the New 
User problem once and for all.

				At this year's <a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/">International Conference on Music Information Retrieval</a>,
 they've added a session where researchers can highlight late breaking

submissions are not reviewed, any submitted abstract will be accepted.  
If there are more submissions than are allowed, then "presentations that
 contribute to a balanced session will be given priority".  The 
conference website has had a server problem and has been down for a week
 or so, and since the deadline is approaching, I thought it would be 
good to remind folks of the deadline.
<p>
<strong>Submission deadline:  July 24, 2008

<strong>Submission details:
</strong></p><p>
Late-breaking / demo submissions: A special session during the ISMIR-08 schedule will be dedicated to:
</p><ol>
   <li> the presentation of preliminary results and ideas which are not yet fully formed nor systematically evaluated; and
   </li><li>the demonstration of applications that are of interest to the MIR community.
</li></ol>

These “late breaking / demo” submissions will not be reviewed and will 
not have associated papers on the proceedings. They have been assigned a
 late deadline. Submissions should be emailed to:

and affiliation(s), and a 100-200 word abstract outlining the work to be
 presented. Abstracts will be published online. Should there be more 
submissions than allowed by the available presentation space, 
presentations that contribute to a balanced session will be given 
priority. Limitations on the number of papers per author apply.

	<div class="entry-content">
				Over the weekend I traveled to Chicago to attend the AAAI workshop on <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/itwp08/program.html">Intelligent Techniques for Web Personalization and Recommender Systems</a>.
  At the workshop 10 research groups presented their work, including 3 
papers that were related to using social tags for recommendation.  I 
found the two talks being presented by the DePaul researchers to be 
particularly interesting and relevant to the work we are doing here in 
Sun Labs.  

<ul>
<li> 	 Personalization in Folksonomies Based on Tag Clustering
by Jonathan Gemmell, Andriy Shepitsen, Bamshad Mobasher, Robin Burke - 
describes using unsupervised clustering of social tags as intermediaries
 between a query and and a set of items.  Terms in the query are 
weighted based upon their affinities to particular clusters to help 
disambiguate queries. For example, if I am a delicious user and I tag 
lots of resources with tags related to programming, and I issue a search
 query with 'java' in it, I'm more likely to be given search results 
related to the Java Programming Language instead of results about 
Starbucks or South Pacific Islands.

</li><li> A Framework for the Analysis of Attacks Against Social Tagging
 Systems by JJ Sandvig, Runa Bhaumik, Maryam Ramezani, Robin Burke, 
Bamshad Mobasher - in this talk JJ presented their framework for 
analyzing attacks against social tagging systems and showed how they 
could use the framework to evaluate the impact different types of 
attacks could have on retrieval algorithms built on top of tagging 
systems.
</li></ul>

At the end of the talks we had an interesting  discussion session where 
we explored some of the challenges in recommendation. It was fascinating
 to hear the different perspectives.
<p>
I really enjoyed the workshop and was glad to be invited. It was really 
well run - and the papers were top notch. Apparently, they only had room
 to accept about 30% of the submitted papers.  They should be posting 
the papers on the <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/itwp08/program.html">workshop site</a> soon, along with the slides from my talk.

				If you have an iPhone and you like music just drop whatever you are 
doing and download and install the free Shazam iPhone app.  Shazam is a 
song-id application.  If you hear a song and would like to know the name
 and the artist,  just fire up the Shazam app, wait a dozen seconds 
while Shazam listens, and Shazam will tell you the artist, album and 
track. It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_fingerprint">audio fingerprinting technology</a> to make it all happen.
<p>
<img src="support_files/_photo-5.jpg" alt="photo-5.jpg" border="0" height="480" width="320">
</p><p>
Now I've seen lots of audio fingerprinters in my day (we've even created
 our own here in the labs), but I've never had the chance to use one in 
the wild like this, and it is a lot of fun to use - and I get a kick 
every time it gets it right (which is almost always).    The app really 
feels like magic. It also is quite robust to noise and listening 
conditions.  I tried it with my little laptop speakers while sitting in 
the kitchen with the dishwasher running and my lovely wife talking to 
me. I've tried it in the car, on the highway with the windows open. It 
seemed that as long as I can hear the music, so can Shazam.   
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_photo-3.jpg" alt="photo-3.jpg" border="0" height="480" width="320">
</p><p>
In my experience, Shazam is also really accurate - it has almost always 
given me the correct answer.  Sometimes, it doesn't know the answer, and
 it will tell me so - but if it does give me a result, I can count on it
 being correct.  The Shazam index of music seems to be pretty big.  It 
was able to identify every song on the local head-banger radio station 
with no trouble, along with most things I tried in my personal 
collection, including recent releases like the latest Weezer album.  
Unsurprisingly, It was not able to identify songs that were pretty deep 
into the long tail - it didn't recognize "<a href="https://www.myspace.com/harryandthepotters">Harry and the Potters</a>", or any of my <a href="http://magnatune.com/">Magnatune</a> music.
</p><p>
Shazam keeps track of your 'tags' - the songs you've ID'd with the app. 
This lets you keep a log of all of the tracks that you've encountered in
 a day so you can follow up later on.  It creates links to iTunes so you
 can buy the track, as well as links to YouTube videos of the track or 
artist. You can even take and attach a photo to a tag to help you 
remember the context of the tagging.

</p><p>
The application info page for Shazam says that it only going to be made 
available for free for a limited time, so grab it for free while you 
can.  It really is a cool and useful app.
</p><p>
<em>Update</em> - For the curious, Shazam presented a paper describing 
the technology behind their fingerprinter at ISMIR 2003. The paper is a 
good read:
<a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/%7Edpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf">An Industial-Strength Audio Search Algorithm</a> (Note that the main ISMIR site is down, so this is a pointer to a cached copy at Columbia).

		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Today I tried out the new Last.fm iPhone client.  It is pretty cool.
 It captures the most relevant bits of Last.fm.  All of my radio 
stations are there: Personal Radio, Recommended Radio, Loved Tracks 
Radio, etc.  I can see upcoming events, my personal music charts.
<p>
<img src="support_files/_photo-2.jpg" alt="photo-2.jpg" border="0">
</p><p>
The Now playing screen is especially slick - you can 'love' or 'ban' a 
track, read an artist bio, view the artist tags, find events related to 
the 'now playing' artist. It will scrobble the tracks it plays.
</p><p>
Probably the best part of the player is the sound quality. It sounds 
really good when compared to some of the other iPhone internet radio 
clients.  (From what I can tell, I don't think Pandora's client even has
 stereo output (for shame!)).
</p><p>
I do have a few quibbles .. but since this is a 1.0 client, I'm sure they will be addressed right away. 
</p><ul>
<li> First of all, Last.fm's corporate color is red - which on the 
iPhone is typically reserved for really important things like "End the 
call". The Last.fm client however uses red everywhere - so when I look 
at the last.fm client I always think there's something wrong.  
</li><li>I wish I could tag artists or tracks with the iPhone.  Right 
now, I can only look at the tags that have been applied to the tracks.  
</li><li> The volume control only lets me turn the volume up. Sometimes, I like to turn my music down too.
</li><li> You pay a price for the good sound quality. It took a couple 
of minutes to buffer a song over the edge network, and it was rather 
unreliable, with pauses mid-song while more of the song was buffered. I 
wouldn't recommend using the client unless you are connected to a WiFi 
client.  When connected to WiFi it would take 10 seconds or so to buffer
 a song and even on WiFi once in a while, the playback of a song would 
pause while more of the song was streamed into memory.  Not a good 
listening experience.  
</li><li> Probably the biggest problem is that as soon as you want to do
 anything else with your phone, the Last.fm client quits and the music 
stops. Of course, this is not Last.fm's fault, but it does take away 
from the overall enjoyment of the music if you have to start a new 
listening session after every time you need to check your mail.
</li></ul>
I hope to see more Last.fm fu in the next version of this app.  There 
are lots of interesting things that could be added - geotagging of 
music, finding people nearby that have similar music tastes.
<p>
The last.fm iPhone client is nicely done - the price is right - so if you have an iPhone ... you should get this app.

				From the <a href="http://www.radioparadise.com/">Radio Paradise</a> home page:
<p>
<em> 	 Fire update: (7/9/08) As you might have heard, the town of 
Paradise is once again threatened by a fire. This time, our house/office
 is within the precautionary evacuation zone, but we're safely out of 
the area. As long as the air-conditioner in our server room holds out 
(it's expected to be 106 degrees F today) there shouldn't be any 
interruptions in our service. </em>
</p><p>
Radio Paradise is my favorite Internet Radio station.   I really hope 
that the fires bypass Bill's server room (and house/office).  We don't 
want to see Radio Paradise turn into Radio Inferno.

  On a very rare occasion, I'll see a book in a bookstore that will 
scream to me 'buy me'.  This book is one of those .. edited by Dj 
Spooky, with a forward by Cory Doctorow, and from MIT Press I knew I 
couldn't pass this book up.

 Rhythm Science was about the flow of things, Sound Unbound is about the
 remix--how music, art, and literature have blurred the lines between 
what an artist can do and what a composer can create. In Sound Unbound, 
Rhythm Science author Paul Miller aka DJ Spooky that Subliminal Kid asks
 artists to describe their work and compositional strategies in their 
own words. These are reports from the front lines on the role of sound 
and digital media in an information-based society. The topics are as 
diverse as the contributors: composer Steve Reich offers a memoir of his
 life with technology, from tape loops to video opera; Miller himself 
considers sampling and civilization; novelist Jonathan Lethem writes 
about appropriation and plagiarism; science fiction writer Bruce 
Sterling looks at dead media; Ron Eglash examines racial signifiers in 
electrical engineering; media activist Naeem Mohaiemen explores the 
influence of Islam on hip hop; rapper Chuck D contributes "Three 
Pieces"; musician Brian Eno explores the sound and history of bells; 
Hans Ulrich Obrist and Philippe Parreno interview composer-conductor 
Pierre Boulez; and much more. "Press 'play,'" Miller writes, "and this 
anthology says 'here goes.'"</em>.

				It seems like there's always something to do ... I ended up spending
 a good part of my Independence Day working on a couple of journal 
papers (mostly on one, the co-authors are doing the good work on the 
other).  I'm also preparing a talk for next weekend's <a href="http://maya.cs.depaul.edu/%7Emobasher/itwp08/program.html">AAAI Workshop on Intelligent Techniques for Web Personalization and Recommender Systems</a>.
  With the two journal articles due this week along with a talk, I'll be
 pretty busy ... but I really want to take a break for a day and take <a href="https://uncrownedroyalty.blogspot.com/">#4 daughter</a> on hike in the White Mountains - here's one of my favorite spots:

				Instead of relying on machines to recommend music, John Scalzi does something radical ... he asks his readers to<a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=951"> recommend some music to 're-hipify' him</a>.
  He's received lots of interesting recommendations - funny thing, no 
one asked John what kind of music John likes ... so apparently human 
recommenders are not stymied by the 'new-user' cold-start problem. 
They'll just recommend things that they like.  John does hint that he 
doesn't like Emerson, Lake and Palmer - what's with that? Well ... no 
recommendations from me!
