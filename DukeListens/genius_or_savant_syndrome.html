			<h2>How smart *is* the Genius?</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				Here's a first look at the new Genius feature of iTunes 8.  First of
 all, there have been a few reports that the Genius feature will be '<a href="http://atlchris.com/250/is-itunes-genius-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-pandora/">Pandora-like</a>.'
 This is not true - the iTunes recommendations seem to be rather 
run-of-the-mill collaborative filtering recommendations based upon the 
wisdom of the crowds - as compared to the core technology behind Pandora
 which uses a detailed content-analysis of the music (by a trained staff
 of musicians) to generate recommendations.
<p>
So how are the Genius recommendations and playlists?  Well, there are 
some funny bits to start off with.  For instance, if try to get 
recommendations based upon a Beatles song, the 'Genius' can't help you 
at all.
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_beatles-genius.png" alt="beatles-genius.png"><img src="support_files/_beatles-genius.png" alt="beatles-genius.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
Instead, it just falls back on what's popular.  It doesn't even try to 
match the Genre (britpop? 60s psychedelia) or artist (John Lennon, 
Wings?).  Pink and Rihanna are right out.  This glaring gap is not just 
confined to the Beatles, but it seems to occur for other artists like 
Bob Seger, and AC/DC that have shunned the iTunes store .
</p><p>
Similarly, for long tail artists, the Genius didn't have too much to 
say.  For example, the Genius recognized artist DJ Markitos and was 
ready to sell me another DJ Markitos album, but couldn't offer me any 
other recommendations:
</p><p>
<a href="http://support_files/_markitos.png"><img src="support_files/_markitos.png" alt="markitos.png" border="0"></a>
</p><p>
When I avoid the long tail, or the iTunes-averse artists, I can coax the
 Genius to give me some real recommendations.  The first thing I notice 
is that the recommendations seem to be artist-based and not album or 
track-based.  For instance if I select as a seed track Emerson Lake and 
Palmer's 'Food for your Soul' (which is a big band jazz-fusion  track), I
 get recommendations for Yes, Jethro Tull, The Moody Blues, Procol 
Harem, and Renaissance. When I pick ELPs - Two Part Invention (Bach on a
 xylophone), I get the same recommendations for tracks by Yes, The Moody
 Blues, Procol Harem, Renaissace etc. And surprise, surprise, if I pick a
 progressive rock track by ELP I get recommendations for the same set of
 artists.
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_elp-genius.png" alt="elp-genius.1.1.png" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" border="0">
</p><p>
The same is true for the playlists generated by the Genius - the Genius 
just picks tracks from similar artists regardless of how well the track 
is representative for the artist.  For instance, on the album 'Return to
 the center of the earth' by Rick Wakeman  the tracks alternate between 
music and narration.  If I use one of the narration tracks as a seed, 
the Genius gives me run of the mill tracks by progressive rock artists. 
No track-similarity is used to generate the playlists.  This is not 
Pandora-like behavior.
</p><p>
So, the Genius isn't great with the long tail, and can't give you good 
recommendations based upon a track or an album. So, how does it do with 
regular old recommendations? Let's look at a few:
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: Dazed and Confused by Led Zeppelin.
<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>: Spoon, RHCP, Pure Parie League, 
Chuck Berry, System of a Down, Madonna,  Linkin Park (the Chuck Berry 
song was the Christmas ditty'Run Rudolph Run')
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>I think we are seeing some extreme popularity bias here. The artists just don't match. 
<br><strong>My Score:</strong> D
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: My Name is Jonas by Weezer<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>: Audioslave, Death Cab For Cutie, blink-182, Tenacious D, Bright Eyes, Weezer, The Shins
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>No clunkers this time, but nothing new - no novelty or serendipity. I could get a much better list from All Music guide<br><strong>My Score:</strong> C
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: Fanfare for the Common Man by Emerson Lake and Palmer<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>: Yes, Focus, Genesis, The Moody Blues, Procol Harum
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>All recommendations from the progressive 
rock bands of the 70s. Again, no clunkers, but this list is not going to
 help people find new music - no Gentle Giant, no Porcupine Tree or 
Dream Theater.  This is classic rock radio<br><strong>My Score:</strong> C
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: Fidelity by Regina Spektor<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>:
 Ingrid Michaelson, Augustana, Lily Allen, Hellgoodbye, Mat Kearney, KT 
Tunstall, Corinne Baily Rae, Blue October, OK Go, Death Cab for Cutie, 
Gwen Stefani, Dashboard Confessional, Jason Mraz, John Mayer
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>Regina Spektor is a quirky indie 
singer-songwriter. One of these recommendations seem good to me: Ingrid 
Michaelson (hadn't heard of her, and she has that indie vibe), but the 
rest are just bad, (the Gwen Stefani recommendation is downright 
laughable). One good recommendation in ten - not too good<br><strong>My Score:</strong> D
</p><p>
</p><p>
<strong>Seed song:</strong>: Money by Pink Floyd<br> <strong>Recommendations:</strong>:
 Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Cream, ZZ Top, Pink Floyd, Deep 
Purple, Alice Cooper, Blue Oyster Cult, The Rolling Stones, Steppenwolf
<br><strong>Comments:</strong>Another set of artists from the greatest hits of the 60s and 70s album. Yawn<br><strong>My Score:</strong> D
</p><p>
I like to rate recommendations on 4 factors:
</p><ul>
<li> <strong>Relevance</strong> - how well do the recommended items 
match the taste - the genius does OK here, with a few glaring errors 
like the Gwen Stefani recommendation for Regina Spektor.
</li><li> <strong>Novelty</strong> - how well does the recommender find 
items that I haven't heard of - the Genus doesn't fair well at all - 
when it did recommend items that I hadn't heard of, they were almost 
always irrelevant.
</li><li> <strong>Reach</strong> - how far does the recommender get into
 the long tail. The Genius couldn't give recommendations for the long 
tail items that I tried, nor did it give recommendations that were far 
into the tail (and I couldn't steer it to hipster items).
</li><li> <strong>Transparency</strong> - how well does the recommender 
explain the recommendations.  A recommender like Pandora does a great 
job explaining why an item was recommended, however, the Genius doesn't 
even try to explain its recommendations.
</li></ul>
<p>
The iTunes Genius is just a run-of-the-mill collaborative filtering 
recommender - the recommendations are nothing special - there's no 
advanced content analysis like you get from <a href="http://www.musicip.com/">MusicIP</a>. There's no deep analysis of content and context like <a href="http://the.echonest.com/">The Echo Nest</a>.  There's no social community or tags like at <a href="https://last.fm/">Last.fm</a>. There's no transparency in the recommendations like at <a href="https://pandora.com/">Pandora</a>. - the Genius just gives rather pedestrian recommendations and playlists.  
</p><p>
Apple and iTunes are at a choke point in the music ecosystem - Apple has
 an opportunity to help people explore for and discovery new music. It 
is good to see Apple recognize this and at least start to provide 
recommendation tools. I hope they will start to look at all of the 
interesting work being done by researchers in the <a href="http://recsys.acm.org/">Recommenders</a> and <a href="http://ismir2008.ismir.net/">Music Information Retrieval</a> community and try to make their Genius a little smarter.

<p>Nice summary Paul.  I agree that they could be doing so much more with track-level detail.  </p>


<p>From what I can determine/imagine, the "Genius Processing" sends the 
metadata from your ITL (iTunes Library) file up to Apple Skynet and they
 make massive Collaborative Filtering comparisons based on the available
 tag data (usually Album, Artist, Track Title and Genre).   </p>


<p>They then create similarity lists for each song based on the global 
catalog (maybe bumping up ranking points for top ratings or play 
counts), filter by Genre (so you're *less* likely to get James Brown and
 Coldplay next to each other) and then send down your static lists, 
ready for you to call up on request.</p>


<p>They're doing some interesting stuff regarding what we call "Pruning"
 (making sure that no one artist totally dominates the list and making 
it less likely that two songs by the same artist get played back to 
back).  And the "Top Songs You're Missing" recommendations are pretty 
interesting in that they recommend songs by the artist that you may not 
have in your collection yet.  I would see value in another 
Recommendation level that is more specific than "Top Songs In X Genre."</p>


<p>Looking at a playlist from Simon &amp; Garfunkel's "The Only Living 
Boy in New York" gets interesting since it is really a quiet folk-pop 
song, but also appeared on the "Alternative" soundtrack for 'Garden 
State'...the playlist is an interesting mix of alt-rock like The La's 
and the Shins, but also The Stones and the Beach Boys.  </p>


<p>The fascinating thing is that it picked "Wild Horses" by the Stones 
and "God Only Knows" by the Beach Boys -- Two very quiet, slow, 
"Searching" and "Poignant" songs.  Why didn't it grab "Satisfaction" or 
"California Girls"?  Is there some element of Machine Listening or 
tempo/BPM analysis going on?  Thoughts?</p>


<p>I had another quiet '70s rock playlist that had "Beth" by Kiss in 
there. Not any of the kick-arse heavy rock songs by Kiss, just the AOR 
ballad.  How did that stumble in there?  </p>


<p>I have to say that I don't give it the close-to-failing grade that 
you do. It ain't all the way there, but it's a good first step.  It may 
get better as more of us upload our collections.  (Then again, it might 
get diluted as non-early adopters dump their lousy music into the soup).</p>

<p>Thanks Zac</p>


<p>&gt; Is there some element of Machine Listening or tempo/BPM analysis going on? Thoughts?</p>


<p>I don't think so.  When I use an atypical track from an artist as the
 seed (as with the ELP examples), I get tracks from similar artists - 
the tracks don't match at all.</p>


<p>I'm sure the Genius will increase iTunes sales quite a bit - so from 
that point of view, I think the Genius will be a success. However as a 
tool that will help my discover new music, the Genius is not the 
replacement for Pandora or Last.fm (as the mainstream media has been 
suggesting).  The recommendations lack the novelty, relevance, 
serendipity, steerability and reach needed to be useful to help me find 
new music.  </p>


<p>This morning the iTunes Genius suggested that since I like  Led 
Zeppelin's Stairway to Heaven that I should buy "Love will keep us 
together" - by "The Captain and Tennille".   It is recommendations like 
this that make me wonder what is going on under the Genius hood.</p>

<p>Well i found it rather interesting that it had no recommendations for
 not so major music. I tried it out with different drum'n bass songs 
(Swing Time by Hidden Agenda and Heckler&amp;Koch by A Guy Called 
Gerald) and i wouldnt create a playlist at all. </p>


<p>Now it seems strange why ndexing of the music collection takes so 
long (1 hour for 8000 songs on my side) if it doesnt do any analysis 
kind of thing.</p>

<p>Me:<br>
Simple, its using Cuil as a backend. :)</p>


<p>I strongly agree with your comments about Apple/itunes being a choke 
point to innovation. With the slow proliferation of streaming devices 
I've tried to interest a number of friends to look at them, but the best
 candidates are always locked into itunes drm.</p>


<p>Given Pandora's problems, what I would really like to see is a 
recommendation engine that focuses on cc/free music as a way to 
introduce people like me to newer bands that aren't encumbered by record
 company contracts.</p>

<p>I tend to agree with Zak, I have found that the genius tends to pick 
songs of a similar feel, at least for the more popular artists. <br>
It will be interesting to see how if it changes/improves when more users info gets into the cloud.</p>
