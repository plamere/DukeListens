			<h2>What is the iTunes genius doing?</h2>
		</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
				I've just upgraded to iTunes 8.0. I am eager to try out the new 
Genius feature (perhaps you didn't notice Steve Jobs mentioning it at 
the "Let's rock" announcement today).  When you enable the 'Genius' 
feature, iTunes asks you to agree to let iTunes send data about your 
iTunes library and your play history to the iTunes cloud. 
<p>
Once you agree, the Genius goes through a 3 step process 
</p><p>
<img src="support_files/_genius-enrollment.png" alt="genius-enrollment.png" border="0">
</p><p>
I'm a bit puzzled about what the Genius is doing during this first step.
  I have about 10K songs in my iTunes library. The Genius took about a 
half hour to 'gather information' about my library. That's about 200 ms 
per track ... not enough time to do any kind of analysis (not even 
enough time to decode an MP3, let alone do any significant processing). 
 iTunes already has a database containing all the info it needs.  
Perhaps it is calculating an item-item similarity matrix for my artists,
 albums and tracks before it sends the data off too the cloud.  This 
would save Apple a lot of CPU cycles.
</p><p>
Once iTunes has finished gathering information about my library it sends
 it all to Apple and a few minutes later, Apple sends back my Genius 
results. Which means that I can now get recommendations for 
recommendations.

More about the recommendations in the next post.

<p>I don't use iTunes, but Erik showed me the genius feature today. He 
found several examples where the results didn't make sense, and some 
where the results were pretty good. Overall it seems Apple kept things 
nice and simple. I'm curious how Apple fans will respond to the new 
feature.</p>

<p>Yeah, it seems to use comparisons from within the store -- what 
others bought who also bought the song that you chose. Seems to work 
pretty well, anyway, but not as well as Pandora. </p>

<p>Guano Apes with Juli? German groups alright, but they couldn't be 
more different. If there is only CF, that song puts you in touch with 
all German profiles. If there is some sort of CBF at artist-level they 
may need to adjust weights :)</p>

<p>I have been using iTunes since 4 and while I don't rely on it to make
 or choose songs for me, I can't see how much of a genius the Genius 
feature would be. I am the Genius!</p>

<p>I would guess that iTunes Genius is doing some sort of collaborative 
filtering on your Music (along the lines or people who liked X also 
liked Y). Amazon have been doing it for year.</p>


<p>The great thing is that you can produce a very compact recommendation
 model in a relatively small amount of data that can then be uploaded to
 a handheld device (such as an IPod Touch). (This is based on my 
experiences working on CF for Net Perceptions several years ago)</p>


<p>The way that the Genius playlist feature on the Touch will refuse to 
produce recommendations for some tracks is very reminiscent.</p>


<p>I would expect that the quality and depth of recommendations will 
improve as more people make use of the genius feature, upload their 
playlists to Apple and this data is then processed and used to update 
iTunes. </p>

<p>I think Genius is a scam to get those of us who haven't got an iStore
 account to sign up so Apple can make more money from us.  I was 
intrigued by the Genius playlist feature so I head on to the store to 
sign up. Then I read the ULA.  Does anyone else think it's odd that you 
are locked in for life as soon as you sign up???</p>


<p>Here is the line that shocked me:</p>


<p>"The iTunes Store service commences immediately when you begin to 
download Products from the iTunes Store and YOU WILL NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO
 CANCEL YOUR CONTRACT once the service commences."</p>


<p>Not as bad as the Google Chrome ULA but sheeesh, I never expected this sort of thing from Apple!</p>


<p>Is Genius really worth it?</p>


<p>Not for me.</p>

<p>Its absolutely worth it. I plugged in the song Breakfast by the 
mattress by Kristoffer Ragnstam which is a recently discovered favorite 
song. (I found I loved it yesterday) And I have thousands of songs on my
 itunes I havn't even listened to yet. So I made a playlist from it and I
 love it, I'm finding other songs in my itunes that I love and havn't 
listened to yet. Then I have these playlists in my ipod so I can 
continue discovering my own itunes anywhere I go.</p>

<p>my own test reveal that genius will include songs that are in your 
library that are not available in the itunes store in a mix but you 
cannot build mixes off of those songs, which is very interesting.</p>

<p>Big scam! This is information mining at its worse. I have no use for 
this, or the embedded iTunes store. If anyone's figured out a way to 
disabled Genius, please post.<br>
Once a critical mass of the market has been hooked on iTunes, and all 
their music assessed and inventoried, they are going to pull the rug and
 disable any use of music not properly licensed or purchased. Have a 
nice day!</p>

<p>How to disable it?  Well, you can not turn it on in the first place 
(it's opt-in), or turn it off by selecting the option the Apple scammers
 cleverly disguised as "disable genius" on the store pull-down menu.</p>


<p>But they must be very clever blokes there at apple, if they figured 
out a way to distinguish illegal mp3s from the multitude of legal mp3 
sources, and figured out a way to break mp3 files willy-nilly.  What a 
big scam, indeed.</p>

<p>This is a potentially cool feature, but all the playlists I got out 
of it (when it worked) were not very good. Most of my library is NOT 
mainstream.</p>


<p>I cant believe that there is no listing for Oingo Boingo, Luther 
Allison, the Beach Boys and other more "popular" bands. Forget trying to
 make a list with the band known as the Beatles who was a little popular
 - maybe you've heard of them...</p>


<p>Yet by the same token, it DID create a plylist from more obscure 
bands (by mainstream preferences)such as the Nekromatics, BiGod 20 and 
Leatherstrip.</p>


<p>This makes NO sense what-so-ever. IMO this feature is broken and not 
worth using if you listen to music that is NOT listed on the iTunes 
store.</p>

<p>You guys ever considered that this is part of biggest music companies
 trying to get the people prosecuted for downloading music illegally? 
(come on every song u ever downloaded without paying for it is 
technically illegal.) Its funny that itunes 8 came out after biggest 
downloaders received letters saying they are being warned once... and 
some even been already prosecuted and fined.</p>


<p>I got 10k of music... thats pretty much 10grand worth if u count each track as a pound...</p>


<p>Once it sends info about ur music it has you IP.. hense your home 
adress... and probably will continue loggin if u switch networks or move
 houses or whatever. Just if u dont receive a letter now.. means u got 
lucky there are people that downloaded more music than u.</p>


<p>Also if i remember right.. there are plenty of cases where people 
sent info about their windows to microsoft and if it was illegal copy 
microsoft pretty much hacked and rended the hard drive useless.</p>

<p>Igor - it's naive to think that Apple are going to contact your ISP 
with a court order to gain your personal details based on your IP 
address at a given moment in time just because you have a handful of 
MP3s that aren't strictly legal.</p>


<p>Microsoft and Apple will not "hack" anything as that would be illegal
 and corporations would get a significantly higher penalty for doing 
that than an individual.  Also - the cost to them (not retail) of 1 copy
 of Windows versus the time and money it would take for an employee or 
contracter to do any form of malicious damage to an INDIVIDUAL is 
absurd.</p>


<p>Don't buy into all the scare tactics or into the hearsay.</p>
